all by itself if feels really strange and i am worried my brakes will quit working one of these days i checked my brake fluid and the reservoir was full but the fluid itself looked really dirty like dirty oil i called my mechanic and he told me i need a new brake master cylinder which will cost me a whopping you are not alone my honda accord with miles on it started showing the same behaviori replaced the brake master cylinder myself it took about an hour and cost about sure beats paying to have someone else do it if i wanted to rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one it would have cost only to for the rebuild kitthe honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to two bolts attach it to the engine compartment two brake lines enter the master cylinder the tricky part was that the brake lines were stuck tight my craftsmen open end wrench rounded off the bolt heads i had to use vise grips to loosen those suckers wow best invention since sliced bread after that it was very easy bolt the new part in place add new brake fluid and bleed the brakesthis is quite easy even for a beginner my local auto parts store had a repair manual for the honda accord

know theyve given units to the florida highway patrol county sheriffs a and some local governmentsthe real question is why this is the hook geico and other ins cos can tell which drivers represent risk this is a determination they can make after you receive a speeding ticket from one of geicos lidar units most drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two but this gives them the opportunity to raise rates for equal risk its called extra profits they also know how silly the nsl is and how it is almost universally ignored driving in excess of the nsl gets you a ticket an increase in your rates points on your license but it doesnt make you a riskier driver to insurelike the sound of this like the people who thought up the scheme go geicounless you have some driving

other detectors ive gotten so many falses that ive begun to ignore someo of the warnings because i didnt want to drive like i had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedalthat directional indicator really really helps plus more info is almost always better than less info no matter how smart radar detectors get the human brain is usually smarter so if im going to make a decisio based on information at hand i want all the info i can get plus if you divide the overall strength of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported youll find that eachbogey is pretty weak and therefore

heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than gas engines because the emit less of carbon monoxide hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen co hc nox but they can put out a lot of particulate matter i heard something about legislation being discussed to clean up diesel emissions is there anything in the works to install scrubbers for diesels how about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars would it be any different than a catylitic converter id assume easier since were removing particulate matter instead of converting gasses lets hear peoples opinions this really bugs me the emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars in california what a bunch of crap diesel is the fuel of choice for enviromental benefit in europe while here its illegal for the same reason the particulates are nothing but carbon they are just an annoyance at worst nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions torque or engine durability its also cheaperdiesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels the main reasonthey are considered cleaner is because they are better at the emissions weactually measure and regulate but they also contribute additional emissionswhich have long been determined to be as harmful but no suitable control orlimits have been defined current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissionsand suspended particles and less of a photochemical reaction diesel particulatesare now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity and alcohols emitsignifcantly more aldehydes a known carcinigen than gasoline the evidenceis mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death we mayhave been ignoring the effects of the alternativesand anyone who thinks diesels are so great should go and spend a few hours inrush hour traffic in some cities in europe there the stench of the diesels isawful

frankbsadhpcom frank ballsubject re rfi art of clutchless shifting im not familiar with the trannies used in winston cup but in the transam cars ive played with the transmissions were the racing variety with dog clutches instead of sychros in a transmission with dog clutches the gears are always engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches engages the gears to the shafts motorcycle transmissions are the same way shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause transmission damage the only question being how long it takesto grenade something for the trans in my pulsar se it was about k miles but it had a weak tranny in the first place just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro transmission what you described sounds the same to me in fact what little ive studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs and said they were synonymous the gears are always meshed in a synchronized gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting or at least that is what i was taught explain por favourmotorcycle transmissions dont have synchros the engagment dogs are verycorse and sloppy there are maybe teeth dogs on the side of thegears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears backand forth to shift start to apply pressure at the same time theclutch is pulled the clutch is a hand lever and shift quickly if you try a slow lazy shift it will grind you just have to pop it intothe next gear before it has a chance to grind there isnt a neutralbetween gears obviously there is but you cant select it with theshifter so double clutching is not a possibility speed shiftingwhich is what i have always heard clutchless shifting called workspretty well for upshifts with some practice but i usually use theclutchespecially for the lower gearsi think auto as in automobile trannys are similar except that theengagment dogs are very fine with no slop and the addition ofsyncho

driving miles a day at typically mph without any problems im sure i would have been more comfortable driving a benz but no white knucklesno problems with winds and curves then there was the trip back

doing that for that last k miles with my lowly civic with no detriment to either the engine or the clutch and getting excellent mpg to boot id call this an engineering hack to cover up design

cant wait anyone outthere hear anything about it recentlyif everything ive read is correct ford is doing nothing but reskinning the existing mustang with minor suspension modificationsand the pictures ive seen indicate they didnt do a very good jobof itthe new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a year old cargee is it alreadyyes it will still be on the fox program chasis anything that will be different on the new car as far as mechanicals is unknown the suspension will mostlikely be changed as well as the drive drain from what has been printed onit there is no clear idea of what will be done as some say it will havethe modular v and others the current small block just have to wait and seealso is far as styling goes from what i seen is good a return to traditionc scoop on the sides

know thats mho the differences these days between ford and gm are not so much the qualityjust the philosophy it used to be quality and philosophy gm isbarely catching up but they have more room for

im not alone out there when it comes to clutch etc problems on late model hondas if i get a few more supportive responses i will take them to my local honda dealer or maybe send them to the regional rep in southern calif for their input on the problem maybe some group pressure from honda owners can be placed on honda to find a solution such as a retrofit of the clutch or maybe ill just sell the blasted vehicle and go back to driving my year old pickup which was now fixed having clutch problems and caused me to look for what i thought would be a troublefree solution ya sure not to put down honda or anything the accord has performed flawlessly in all other areas for its miles as it is said out of all this something will develop later folksnot alone at all my old accord now in the hands of a sibling has a muchbetter engagement of the clutch even the old civic we keep as a beater feels better in this aspect note that these are cars with kms and kms respectively my prelude blows both of them away in every respect except smooth clutch engagement of course the kawasaki is the bestof the bunch but i need more than wheels most of the timethe prelude has had a dud clutch from day and

most common one is probably the crank that is verysimilar to the i crankwhich flat engines have i style cranks comparing those two engines the i and theflat have no first order shaking forces or rocking moments thei has a second order shaking force while the flat has a secondorder rocking moment the significant thing about the flat ssecond order moment is that it can be easily balanced out by addingmass at the ends of the crank the i however requires a counterrotating shaft with mass to balance out the second order forcesi am sure that subaru and porsche use the boxer configurationand not the inline crank that you analyzed and compared would youcare to reevaluate the other case of a flat four i think that thisconfiguration is perfectly balanced as far as primary secondaryforces and

getfront and rear sensorsyou can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the copdoesnt see it right awayvalentine is the best detector by far as statedby car and driver and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from it also gives the amount of threats it is picking up so if you go through the same place everyday and it always goes off there you can glance at the

been periodically feeding the clutchhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system i knew iwould be selling the car and didnt want to go all the way to solving theproblemi should add that the clutch is original and that ive had to adjust thepedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder inorder to actuate the clutchmy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedalthe angle of the piston rod attached to the pedal is off the axix of thecylinder thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming itwhat do you think of that as an explanation can you suggest a possible fixshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put innow the same problem except that the above diagnosis doesnt explainwhy all of

good years to consider for reliability lookshorsepower in that order believe it or not horsepower is not a mainconcern if i want to go fast i get on my motorcycle and what aregood prices to vettes had

they thought a miata was a good dealalso what would insurance look like im male single i mightwait until im to get the car lower insurance would the fact thati mainly drive the other car lower it is there some type of classiccar or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under k milesper year my dad has a vette and its on what you say classic insurance basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving time which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would probably suit your needs for limited mileagemy origional inquires to my insurance agent i can drive my convertable for miles or less per year i must keep it in a locked garage and it will cost me of the stated value per year does this sound right ive also been looking at vettes recently and found a convertiblethat i like at a dealer i currently own an ford escort gt whichis insured through state farm i called em up and asked about the rates if i sell the escort the vette insurance is per months if i keep the escort the vette insurance is per months theescorts insurance goes down by to approx per months im male and have a good driver discount another variable wouldbe where you live best bet is to just call up some insurance brokersand get a quote state farm says they base the price on the fair market value of the carwhich is determined by an outside apprasier they look in the newspaperand call up dealers to find out what the going rate is and adjust it forthe condition of the car to get the values above they went on the selling price of the car thedealers asking price is i need to do research to find out ifthis is reasonable in any case i told state farm the value was kget an appraiser to look at the car he will check serial numbers and look for origional equipe depending on what mods have been done the car could be worth only k problems like wrong engine trans wrong paint type vetts used lacquer an modification would reduce tthe value but your looking for a

taurus sho moving up from drivinga toyota celica st and a oldsmobile cutlass i have beeninterested in buying a sho for about five months and have been combingthe classifieds in denver and chicago every week i bought aremarkably clean maroonred sho with k miles on it for as far as i can tell this is about under blue book and i stillhave another miles before the extended service plan runs out as one should with any pre shos i made sure that the car wasalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well ashaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachmentshowever my sho does not have the newer rod shifter i understand ican get this for from any ford service center in addition thecar received the full tuneup at k miles receiving new platinumplugs and valve adjustment for a car with k miles on it the car was virtually immaculatethe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dentsalthough the front airdammolding was covered with lots of smallscratches not surprising since most of the miles were spent on thehighway having driven a smaller twodoor coupe for so long i was a bitconcerned about whether i could get used to driving a larger car tomy surprise the size of the car doesnt bother me at all it seemsjust as nimble as my celica no comparisons with my oldsmobile visibility from the drivers seat is excellent helped mostly by ofthe small the quarterwindows aft of the backseat door windows andin front of the cpillar and rear window parallel parking is a bitmore difficult but other than that i love the size in fact im starting to appreciate the large trunk as i pack upfor a hour drive to washington dc for the summer more on theride later in this reviewengine as with anyone even slightly interested in shos i was veryinterested in the valve l yamaha shogun engine i was notdisappointed base performance of the engine under rpms isgood you can even do reasonable launches from second gear althoughi dont make a practice of this the engine revs smoothly and eagerly tooling around town does not require many shifts this is goodsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the carmore on this later while the performance of the engine under rpms may beunremarkable it undergoes a jekyllhyde transformation once you hithigher revs at rpms a butterfly valve opens and you canliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelvemore valves open up the engine soars to its rpm redline andyou are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding v aroundthe engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at rpm ive noticed that when i drive around town i constantly watch thetach to see how far below rpm i am to go from rpm to you may have to punch the accelerator while torque is more thanadequate it doesnt come fully online until those other valvesare usedtransmission when car and driver first reviewed the car in theymarvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifterinto the car i remember driving a friends parents sho in andremember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive thecar in traffic the clutch was that stiff that was back then the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under aford recall in the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than theone on my toyota celica in fact the friction point seems a bitlarger and more forgiving when playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifterfelt very reasonable the and gates were where youd expectit to be and the shifting action was smooth on the road itsmuch the same but you have to shift slowly make no mistake itsa clumsy shifter when hurrying shifts like when i was initially trying to impressfriends i consistently miss the shift often grope clumsily forthe shift and sometimes even muff the shift i find thispretty amazing in a car like this it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothestshifts when you take your time seems obvious but compared to mytoyota and my friends honda this seems atrocious and clumsysomeone on recautos noted that crxs should blow shos offthelinebecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems morereasonable when you play within these bounds the shifter workssmoothly with no surprises i dont know whether the rod shifterupgrade would help at all along these same lines i initially had trouble shifting gearssmoothly again slowing down the shifts and taking more care tomatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely this tookseveral days for me to get the hang of i think some of my problemswere because ive never had a car with enough power to balk at badshifts in higher gears occasionally i have trouble shifting into reverse the shifterrefuses to enter the gate and i often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear ill be watching this carefully in the next coupleof months a quirk when i upshift and the engine drops back to rpm i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the theengine compartment not terribly loud but the passenger candefinitely hear it i asked about it when i was looking at the caras do all my passengers apparently this is a definitely a shosound and is the gearbox apparently called gear rolloverreplies to my queries on recautos are at the end of this reviewexterior as i mentioned before i am astounded by how well the body of thissho has stood up paint chipping on the front bumper and grille arevirtually nonexistent looking at how older tauri sometimesdont age so gracefully i wonder what the guys at ford diddifferently to the sho bodies the body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matchingcolor body moldings than the stock tauri for some odd reason thesho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares atstoplights of course this could be my overactive imagination shos get fog lights a more open grille a completelymonochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back withsho stenciled in relief ive seen a couple shos whose owners havecolored these in with florescent colors or in black yuck i dont think the car is flashy i like it that way i feelalmost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different anddistinctive enough to those of us who care interior the interior is what really makes me feel like i dont deserve thecar the seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter arecovered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done ina blackgreymetallic scheme the instrumentation is stock taurus except for the mph speedoand rpm tach you get a center console with two cupholders alarge compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrestthat contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coinholders for tollways i think and a compartment for holdingcassette tapes theres mapholders in the doors and an oddly smallglove compartment i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delightedto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in asink hey im really impressed with the ergonomics andthoughtfulness that went into its design and its a before theinterior was upgraded the backseat is bigger than any car ive had why do they need somuch space no smartass comments please the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters fromwhat i hear its not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wearmine is no exception the left side bolster on the drivers hascracked and im not convinced the right bolster is inflating all theway a big surprise for me i forgot that shos dont have a normalhand parking brake instead they have the regular parking brake thatyou press with your left foot too bad again im getting used toit but it seems a bit anachronistic to meride the suspension is nice and stiff too stiff its stiffer thanany car ive had a friends new toyota celica st seems tauterand is still able to soak up bumps better the sho seems stiffer withless ability to soak up bumps driving over railroad tracks is anoisy and jarring affair on the other hand taking turns feelswonderful because the body is so rigid and doesnt flex at all ilistened for that before i bought the car on the highway the ride is great when i drove the car fromchicago back to purdue i had trouble keeping under mph let alonefrom trying to see what mph really feels like its a relativelyquiet ride but the sunroof rattles ive tried to find out whatexactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the windowthat rests on the rails no easy way to get rid of it i think over the past three days ive oscillated between thinking thesuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is waytoo rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i wouldadvise my dad to buy one for himself but ive discovered as withthe shifter if you take your time with shifts youll have no reasonto complain let me explain the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to thewheels i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steermaking the car skitter left and right after i understood this iavoid the limits of traction and im a happy camper again its not body rigidity but the composure of the car as if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavymy first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn thewheel at highway speeds it tracks straight as an arrow but whendriving around a parking lot the higheffort steering didnt seem souseful however its reasonable but it doesnt communicate the roadto the driver as well as a ford probe gt imho its much betterthan the steering on my celica st i wonder how bad this car is during wintermiscellaneous notes gripes the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent some days it rattles loudly other days i look up wondering where all the noise went activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy loud squealing asit retracts on its rails i wonder if there is a quick fix for thisagain other days it completely disappears function of humidity once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspensionand torque steer ive never complained about ride i wish the seats had more support under the thighs also i wish theside bolsters would close more tightly i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive icurrently have goodyear gts that cost the previous owner for four i used to hate the ford stereo systems whose idea was itto use a volume paddle now to my amazement i dontreally mind and sometimes think its an okay ideapretty ridiculous though getting up to rpm sometimes seems to be a chore butthis is no big deal there is more than enough torquedown low i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends ittook me a couple of days before i could really shiftsmoothly from nd to rd gear hard to believe isnt it my car has almost miles on it my parents noted thatit is almost impossible to find a lowmileage sho astute observation imho i wonder how long i can makemy sho last i just bought a book titled drive it foreverfor tips in this department the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop i onceparked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutchafter i started it the car jolted forward and bounced offthe car in front of me no paint damage at all but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal also i began to wonder how strong that brake really is today i backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed the glowing brake light oops the drivers power window creaks when closed all the way the same thing happens in my parents mercury sable oddly all theother windows work smoothly likes im liking the interior amenities more and more each day the cupholders are great i didnt expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much butit really is handy you can lock all the doors bypressing the and buttons together neat andyou can never lock yourself out of the car i really feel like i dont deserve this car i really cantbelieve that i could afford it i got this car ten years ahead of schedule i love this car so much that ive been telling my parents tolook into buying one i love this car so much that iwrote this k file i meant to write a couple of linesand ended up with this if there were a jd powers survey for used car owners i would havean opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car i dont like thinking about getting another car but at thispoint in time im sure id buy another sho for under youcant beat it next time with an airbag and abs though insurancewise this car is also a big win i pay the same premiumsas on my toyota celica despite that it has nearly twicethe horsepower other odds and ends much to my amazement there is no sho mailing list anywheremaybe because the sho registry publication has filled this void ihavent joined yet but ive noticed that queries about shos stillappear on recautos about once a month owners of shos are alwaysquick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars maybe someof the most vocal on recautos ive put together the responses to my questions about the cars

audi s quattroits been a while since ive reviewed a car but today i paid a visitto an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that hemakes a not too sucessful living selling themwithout further delay i will get to the audi s servotronic steeringfor those who are not familiar with what servotronic is it is thename for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf andused in audis and bmwsi have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the pastcouple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives ofthe audi cs quattro and the audi cs fwd i am quite happy toreport now that on the s the servotronic is inoffensive isuppose that due to the fat gumball tires the servotronic has beenloaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation thati have tried it is far from perfect mind you and id be muchhappier if it was an option that i could refuse but on the s i nolonger consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car isruinedthe steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and isuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information thatsome makes it through to the drivers hands so there is feel andthere is accuracy in the ss steering but there is also room forimprovement i consider the ss steering to be better than thejapanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe infeel and engineer it out completely enginewheee what a pressure cooker with just miles on the clock i didnot expect the s to be producing anywhere close to what it will beputting out miles later but still the car packs a terrificpunch for a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that itencourages lazy driving ie low revs high gear it is sosupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that theres only liters of displacement to move this pound car around in such afashion with maximum torque available at rpm and a rpmredline the car can pretty much be left in third all day whichtranslates to a speed range of something like mph achracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity vsthe technical achievement is breadthtakingthrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine infact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame downshiftsare almost unnecessary it is more fun to use the overboost featurethan to rev the engine for those not familiar the s engine featuresup to seconds of additional turbo boost for passing sort of likelighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with theright foot only in third gear blast the car from to in just afew moments simply by flooring the gas as far as the numbers gomaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about lbft incredible for a liter it takes a few moments for it todevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for since this is quitea heavy car ones body parts are not flung around like say the corradovr the acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to ridingin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff also oneis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from theturbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a veryrefined but bland sounding bangeryes audi has refined the to the point where at rpm it sounds asserene as it does at the smoothness is outstanding but not quiteup to the standards of a very good eg a valve bmw id say thatin terms of refinement ie willingness to rev smoothness lack ofharshness under full acceleration it is better than many vs howeverlost in the refinement process is the characteristic cylinder barkthat made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refinedthe valve turbo sounds pretty bland except for the whistle underfull boost subjectively id rate the vw vr engine as being far moremusical than the turbo also audis own v is also far more musicalwith a rorty race car growl when pressed though none of these canmatch its gruntthe only hint of the engines true capacity occurs when one is takingoff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop with the extrainertia from the permanently engaged wd system one has to be somewhatdelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall alternately one could use more revs in both cases a very small priceto pay for such a fantastic engine i think that audi of america shouldoffer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though inextremely small numbers a speed for the much peakier v thecharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic ironicallyin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of theslush marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again chassisive noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relativelymodest tire widths the car comes with firestones of size zrwhich is not uncommon at all however the very attractive spokewheels are no less than inches wide so there is no sidewall bulgewhatsoever combined with the flared wheel arches the s has a mouthwatering macho yet subdued look on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new bodystyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well asroad noise suppression i suppose the two are interrelated but idigress to use a cliche the ss body feels like it has been carvedout of stone flex is totally undetectable even when going over roughroads with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampersdo not cause excessive harshness and while the ss ride quality willnever worry a lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks orpony carsthe servotronic steering has already been mentioned i consider it tobe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering i wasable to test the cars cornering powers without too much trepidation ithink a new concept is at work in this car with its fat gumball tirestalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless on abanked highway on ramp i went in slow and started applying power as iwent around i could feel the g forces build to the point where theskin on my face was being tugged sideways yet the car was totally andcompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs it felt that thelimits were not even close to being approached the g forces werethrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangelyuninvolving you tell the car what you want and it does it end ofstory i think that i am starting to relate more and more to thosereviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsxs clinicalefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the carthe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car prettywell too though ive read that they are prone to fade i am not toosurprised since the s does not have uprated brakes over the base audi fwd harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a morewooden response when cold i am starting to see a trend among theluxurysports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset byadditional braking capacity the lss fade performance is nothing tobrag about neither is the qs or the legends brake fade these daysseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybodys attention is focused onantilock capability comfortfor a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are alsoexcellent the cabin is beautifully appointed with carbonfiber panelinserts in place of the wood trim of the s all the expectedgizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power thisand that the glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removedbecause audi hasnt gotten it to work reliably yet that means that thecar has no boost gauge a real disappointment taking into account howmuch the turbo dominates its performance unusual for the germans the s comes with a honda style moonroof aswell as the very intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switchnoise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldntconsider the lexus advantage in this area to be significant enoughto sway a potential buyer conclusioneven though few will be able to afford an audi s at its sticker priceof k the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has tooffer over the competition the valve turbo is a real gem even ifit doesnt produce ferrari sounds no other luxurysports sedan makeroffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some isworth the extra money all by itself

feature a gimmick so here is more explanation thanks jim for the good comments and opinion from what i understand the valentine can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front rear or both there are only two antennas if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source it sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and notactually using the valentine id like to give some feedback based onreal life experince i keep the valentine in advanced logic modeand it rarely lights up as a christmas tree the only time it doesis when i am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makessense that is does since there are sources coming from many differentdirections i have found the valentine to be consistent in itsreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the areai have found the directional indication to be very useful in one casethere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other as ipassed the first radar trap the direction indication changed thenthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction withother radar detectors i would have assumed that this was due to a reflectionbut with the valentine i knew there was a high probability that therewas another trap and there wason other occasions the directional helped discern a false alarm froma true alarm for example as i pass a source the direction indicatorchanges the directional also allows me to focus my attention as to wherethe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the place when a car is approaching me from the rear with a detectorthat leaks i can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as thecar passes me i can verify the source with other detectors i wouldhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radartrap when there was noneive had the

move it acted as if it were in neutralexcept for dying when clutch is released i finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth less than an inch while i depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter the shifter acted normally after thatwhen this happened i took it to the dealer they checked the clutch it was ok they checked the transmission it was oki had the exact problem a couple of months ago and again lastweek the dealer says there is nothing they can do because mitsubishi the says they have never heard of theproblem and the dealer could not

clutch on a honda accord speed when the clutch is first used in the morning about the first miles of shifting there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up then the clutch shifts smoothly this chatter started when i moved to the san francisco bay area from a lowhumidity environment the dealer stated that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to nonasbestos clutch material no remedy seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates any comments out therethe clutch on my honda civic exv ex in the us does this tooits annoying now that i think about it is worse when the humidity ishigh the dealer also claims theres nothing they can do since the clutch is a selfadjusting hydraulic design yeah rightone of the reasons i sold my civic vx was the chatterygrabby clutchalthough i dint notice it being any worse in humid weather perhaps becauseits always humid around here i was told by honda that it has to do withchanging from asbestos to nonasbestos linings which began around someone could make some good money selling the oldfashion variety if itslegal to manufacture them these days my feeling is that since many othercar makers do not have this problem that its a poor design or engineeringproblem on the part of honda three things to look out for on all hondaproducts clutch chatter bad brake rotors

if a identical car had the cd reduced from to its pretty complex and cd isnt the whole story either cd for cars isusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car so a large carwith a good cd

alarm installed its a viper and has a shock sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic door locksi have this same alarm installed in my syclone it works great the shocksensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i haveon my other car it doesnt trigger if the car is rocked gently by the windbut any kind of shock sets it off even kicking the tire sets it off itworks great what worries me is the hood and hatch if someone could pry them up gently enough then they could bypass the alarmthe shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it you can adjustit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood withoutsetting off the alarm although i know that you cannot pop the hood on thesyclone without setting off my alarm now and yet i have had zero none falsealarms with this system the alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it hasbeen activated in your absence i have been able to trace every alarm to itscause and it was not a false alarm im also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm i guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle my syclone is so tightin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this there aresupplemental power supplies you can put on with this viper alarm but i donthave one i really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarmwont keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that supposedly detects people approcahing the car this is primarily for convertibles i have a convertible and have looked atthis feature in detail alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you wantto get one of these it has zones in it that can be shut down independently sothat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else thatwould trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighteri dont see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that youleave the top down onavoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package it talks topeople as they walk by i saw one installed on a lotus esprit the kids wouldtaunt it seeing how close they could get before it warned them to get back the owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind im interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems and about the viper in general i am real happy with my viper one other feature i really like is you can tuneit to your preferences you can have it arm passively or not you can disablethe chirp for armingdisarming you can have it lockunlock the doors when thealarm is armeddisarmed i like these features i hate the chirp when the alarm armsdisarms so mineflashes the lights only i like the door lock feature although i have to becareful to take my keys with me because it doesnt know if you have left yourkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors but if you aremeticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the rest the car is an ford probe gt that used to be in great shape ron garnett i looked seriously at the alpine system too it is a real nice system butmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor the shock sensor is betterand the viper shock sensor is better cyclethan the optional alpine one imho i think the viper gives you a lot of goodvalue for the money but it isnt absolutely tamperproof no system is except maybe the one that james bond had on his lotus in for your

re service indicator of a bmwdchanciscocom derek chan writes in article aprwestminsteracuk jkjecwestminsteracuk shazad barlas writes derek there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights will come back on after weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know of no other tool anyone else shaz hmm but the service indicators that i have works this way there are green yellow red indicators initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your car the computer will actually sense how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go on and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off after service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting again so i expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator its the first european car i have and changing oil at miles is a surprise to me and its a big plus but i wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time i thought its the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil any bmw owner on the net response welcomed ps my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw derek there is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the bimmer service lightsit will cost you from a mailorder and buying one far outweighsthe possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you trydi it yourself you wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it resetwhy is reseting so important the only reason for doingit is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you forget this in european cars you only need to change the oil every crap anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape andextending its life will change it every inc filter dont waitfor the servive lights to come on before servicing the car i bought a bmw about months ago it had green lights on i have changedthe

radarspeed measurement works a high frequency microwave x band approx ghz and k is approx ghz is sent out and reflected back to theantenna off of an automobile or other objects if an object is movinga doppler shift about hz per mph on x band occurs is measuredand converted to miles per hour these waves bounce all over theplace and they can reflect many times and go in many directionsfrom what i understand the valentine can only tell if thesemicrowaves are coming from the front rear or both there are onlytwo antennas if they are coming from both this in interpreted as aside bogey bogey counts are determined as sources by theirrelative strength to one another even if they are reflections of thesame sourceim certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basison which to make this argument but dont you answer your ownquestion is the reflected signal shifted at all from theact of being reflected if so wouldnt it then be easy forthe detector to discriminate between reflections and directsourceshere is the problem since the microwaves reflect how does the unittell if it is a source or a reflection take a valentine anddrive to the local grocery store that uses an xband radar dooropener you can tell by the small black box above the door pointeddown at about a degree angle and your detector going off when itgets near the valentine will count or bogeys from alldirections

distinction has anything to do with reality isentirely unclear but it is one of those things that internistslove to paw over during rounds supposedly only true clubbingis associated with disease the problem is that the list ofdiseases associated with clubbing is quite long and includesboth congenital conditions and acquired disease since many ofthese diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problemsleading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia it isvery reasonable to get a chest xray however many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a

migraine was re sinus endoscopyi noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularlymotrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but hadforgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts herei generally dont take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because ivefound them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sourcesthat force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is somepelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then muchworse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably dueto the endometriosis coming back ive tried synarel it reducedthe pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediatelyafter i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as theonly real solution to my problem although i dont expect to haveany more children i dont like the idea of having my uterus andone remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i hadthe surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggestedi get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinksthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still planto have children so basically all im left with is toughing outthe pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or somethingsimilar but not aspirin that doesnt work and motrin gave mehorrible gastritis a few years ago so im through with it infact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i takeit regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as ill discuss in a moment generally though i wait untili have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takesseveral hours for it reduce the pain its actually quite effectiveat reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantimeim frequently in severe painthe other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting inbilateral radiculopathy ive had mris xrays ct scan and emgsive had of them and dont intend to ever do that again withnerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as towhat is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i haveseveral bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i thinkit is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scanwas that there are two herniations ll and ll but othershav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniationsthe second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervationcompared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible testcalled something like somatic evoked response which showed that theinternal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is thati sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back painis there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is therei need some analgesicantiinflammatory medication to reduce the painto a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so id always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequentlyand primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physicaltherapy for the last months times a week after the first monthor so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlierbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it ata lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began goingaway but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back whichcould be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i dont havenearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me offtraction about weeks agogetting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoidtaking analgesic for headaches i really cant avoid them entirely becausei have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgotto mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgerybut im avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal withoccassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but ata reduced capacity im a systems engineer and do a lot of readingand writing when the pelvic pain is bad i cant concentrate muchi usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes becausethe pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it cancause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electricshock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets badi cant really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time homeand in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines themigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lotof migraines an average of to a month which last daysive taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me soi reduced the dosage but i dont like the side effects if i takemore than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i willeventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasnt very helpful wheni told him my problems with cafergot he

little buggers over the past six yearssince we moved to nc here are some observations gained frompainful experience reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person some people get tiny red bites others like me are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sorelike affairs chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving i swear that these things will itch for months there is a lot of folklore about chiggers i think most of it is fiction i have tried to do research on the critters since they have such an effect on me the only book i could find on the subject was a single book in uncs special collections library i have not yet gone through what is required to get it based on my experience and that of my family members the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesnt work i recall reading that the theory upon which it is based that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there is false i think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release but this is speculation the best approach is prevention a couple of things work well a good insect repellent deet such as deep woods off liberally applied to ankles waistband etc is a good start there is another preparation called chig away that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally was prepared for the army and is not commercially available in the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i get up on weekends since i literally cant go outside where we live in the country without serious consequences they apparently dont like sulfur much at all you can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them no amount of prevention will be completely successful forget the fingernail polish i have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme reduces the inflamation and swelling and benzocaine relieves the itch i wont tell you all the things ive tried nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned i also think it gains nothing the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery as welldoctors seem not to care much about chiggers the urban and suburbandoctors apparently dont encounter them much and the rural doctorsseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure isuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggerswould make a lot of money gary h

but i think there are just types one issensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and yellow this is why the two most common kinds of colorblindness are redgreen andblueyellowyes i remember that now well in that case the cones are indeedcolor sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimedim not sure who the original respondent was but toreiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum justas rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreenin our case reddish in certain amphibia just as the hoseshoe crablimulus polyphemus photoreceptors respond to a certain portion ofthe spectrum etc it is a common misconception to confound wavelengthspecificity with being color sensitive however the two are notsynonymousso in sum and to beat a dead horse when the outputs of a cone are matched for number ofabsorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelengththe cone outputs are indistinguishable cones are simply detectors with different spectralsensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rodsommatidia or other photoreceptors color vision arises because outputs of receptors whichsample

natural anticanceraids remedies the biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so extremely high andincreasing is that natural methods of treatment and even diagnosis are stillbeing systematically ignored and suppressed by the moneygrubbing and powermongering medical establishment some examples of very low cost natural anticancer remedies are listed inthe following article natural anticancer remedies a rd opinion some of these remedies also work against aids disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store what is important is how they are used and what else is excluded during their use the day fast st day eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes nd day eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including garlic also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings rd day drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want preferably start with to ounces of prune juice with pulp followed by a gallon of pure not from concentrate apple juice then grape juice stay close to your home bathroom th day eat all the unsalted nuts no peanuts and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds almonds contain laetrile th day one gallon of lemonade squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water preferably distilled and add to tablespoons of locallymade honey no sugar drink one glass per hour everyone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp th day same as th day th day same as th day all days eat only the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much distilled water as you want the grape diet eat to ounces of fresh grapes every hours am to pm every day for six days eat nothing else during the six days but drink as much distilled water as you want apple cider vinegar mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar not apple cider flavored vinegar regular vinegar is harmful in a glass of water preferably distilled and drink all of it do this or times per day for weeks then stop for a week repeat if desired do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus as well as against other kinds of fungus infections the seasalt soda bath please keep an open mind fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water pound of sunevaporated seasalt regular salt wont work and pound of fresh bakingsoda soak in this bath for to minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc among other things the seasalt soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of xrays etc as described in the book born to be magnetic vol by frances nixon precautions only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it for at least minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people your greatly expanded aura energyfield during that time could disrupt other peoples fields two hours after the bath eat at least ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures the bath may kill friendly bacteria also better yet take a billionbacteria acidophilus capsule which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of aids because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system because this external bath can kill internal bacteria it may also be a cure for lyme disease do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within days of a full moon nor during major or minor periods as listed in the solunar tables published bimonthly in field stream magazine because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energyfields present at those times do not take this bath more than four times per year miscellaneous natural anticancer remedies for skin cancer apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily and take to tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally for about months dmso dimethyl sulfoxide causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions almonds unblanched unroasted contain laetrile to help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system antioxidants are freeradical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium mcg per day is safe for most people chromium up to mcg per day vitamin a iu per day is safe for most people superoxide dismutase up to units per day vitamin c up to mg per day and bht butylated hydroxy toluene to capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes both types suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes bht might also do these things against aids which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia see the book life extension by durk pearson and sandy shaw hydrogenperoxide dilute twelve drops of hydrogenperoxide in a glass of pure water preferably distilled and drink it do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else apply hydrogenperoxide directly to skin cancers several times per day use hydrogenperoxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various antioxidants described above vitamin mineral supplements are more effective and much less expensive when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources cancer cells can not live in a strong maxwell north magnetic field especially if it is pulsating on and off a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac in my opinion all types of ionizing radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily minute doses of pulsating maxwell north magnetic fields properly made and operated radionicspsionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems some radionicspsionics machines can even take crosssectional xraylike photos of cancer tumors etc without xrays interferon tablets taheebo tea lapacho homeopathy can cure cancer and many other medical problems even drug addiction mg per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble this list is not exhaustive the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un diagnosed cancers as well as prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to ones subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that she has cancer then she should promptly try at least the first remedies described above in sequence starting with the day fast before resorting to the unnatural and expensive mutilations and agonies poison

resentment is the doctor who makes it seem like mostpeople with dizziness can be cured thats definitely not thecase in most cases like i said above it is a long tediousprocess that may or may not end up in a partial cure be sure to say chronic dizziness not just dizziness mostpatients with acute or subacute dizziness will get betterthe vertiginous spells of menieres will also eventually goaway however the patient is left with a deaf earall true and all good pointsto anyone suffering with vertigo dizziness or any variationthereof my best advice to you as a fellowsufferer is thisjust keep searchingdont let the doctors tell you theresnothing that can be donedo your own researchand let yourthis may have helped you but im not sure it is good generaladvice the odds that you are going to find some miracle withyour own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledgefor this or any other disease are slim when good answers to thesethen spending a great deal of time and energy on the medicalproblem may divert that energy from more productive thingsin life a limited amount should be spent to assure yourselfthat your doctor gave you the correct story but after it becomesclear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicinehas no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to jointhe support group and keep abreast of new findings but not tomake a career out of itwell making a career out of it is a bit strong i still believethat doing your own research is very very necessary i wouldnot have progressed as much as i have today unless i had spentthe many hours in stanfords med library as i have doneand years ago it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me so should i have stopped searching thankgoodness i didnt now i found that there is indeed medicinethat helps me i think that what youve said is kind of idealistic that youwould go to one doctor get a diagnosis maybe get a secondopinion and then move on with your lifejust as an example having seen of the top specialists in this field in the country i have received different diagnosesthese are the top names the ones that people come to from all overthe country i have had to sort all of this out myself goingto a support group and in fact heading that support group was helpful for a while but after a point i found it veryunproductive it was much more productive to do library researchmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myselfa recent movie lorenzos oil offers a perfect example of whatim talking about if you havent seen it you should its nota put down of doctors and neither is what im saying doctors areonly human and can only do so much but there are those of usout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missingpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticedi guess im biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingsthat is still so unknown if i had a broken arm or a weak heartor failing kidneys i might not have the same opinion thats because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments with dizziness you just have todecide to live with it or decide to live

youwant to have breaks every minutes starting from ampress f special time to enter an appointment enter hit enter and type some text in saying what the breakis for then press f to set an alarm on this

then witha single keypress be able to set up your daily appointmentswith rsi exercisesthe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple jobthat runs at am and warns you to take a break this willdepend a lot on your operating systemwhile these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if

tool digital watches with countdown timers available fromvarious sources eg casio bp descriptionmany digital watches have timers that count down from a settablenumber of minutes they usually reset easily to that number eithermanually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if youare writing reading driving or doing anything away froma computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the greatadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever youare doing commentsmy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led tomy writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever whichactually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the leftarm improved getting a countdown timer watch has beenvery useful on some occasions where i write a lot in

to change your keyboard mappingso you can type onehandedly or with a different twohanded layout onehanded typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall

ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu lee ladysubject re science and methodology was homeopathy traditionin article lsjgninnlcsaltillocsutexasedu turpincsutexasedu russell turpin writesi wrote or to use a phrasing that i think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foulups in article ciuhbnbunyipccuqozau bdpsychpsyuqozau writes i can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamental aspects of scientific method in fact i dont see the alternative as i dont think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation in saying this i am agreeing with the work of people like kuhn feyerabend and lakatos while methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimentalinvestigation as that to which it is applied it can be criticallyappraised methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes bythe conflicting results they produce this kind of critical appraisaland comparison together with the inappropriateness of existingmethodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution ofmethodologies and how we think about them as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are notwilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith whichis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highestpurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business managementis accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes itwould be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin whatwas the methodology of einstein what was for that matter themethodology of jenner and pasteur in an earlier article russell turpin writes none of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we shouldopen the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedosciencemodern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditionalchinese medicine receive little respect because for the mostpart they use methods and reasoning that the kind of researchlee lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty this doesnot imply that all their treatments are ineffective it doesimply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning areincapable of discovering which treatments are effective andwhich are notfirst of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because idont think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudosciencehomeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should beaccepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas ofhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these thingsincluding some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientificattention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do notuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what iseffective and what is not then science today would not exist for allof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosemethodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to reexaminethose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it isalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be reexamined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate doubleblind studies iscapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that noideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblybe worthy of serious investigation this truly marks ones attitude asdoctrinaire cultist this attitude is not compatible with a belief inreason in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious

then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuseconditions local problems are what youd expect specific musclestendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurtdiffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve musclediscomfort pain burning andor tingling with identifiable areas oftenderness in muscles although theyre not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur heres the theorynormally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whichpass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrictthe blood flow by the time youre exerting of your full poweryoure completely restricting your blood flowwithout fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run outthen they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generatesnasty byproducts like lactic acid which cause painonce one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve theload this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makesthings worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flowand the cycle continuesanother byproduct of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness fromyour nerves they need blood tooanyway when youre typing too much youre never really giving a changefor the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles neverrelax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poorergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard ofnote most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acuteinjuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions haveless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as realtenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitisoccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough tocause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths abilityto lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens getsinflamed and youve got your problemtendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendoncan cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separatingand can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction moreswelling and more pain subacute tendonitis is more common which entailsa dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worsewith repetitive activitycarpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into yourfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms includefeeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensationcts is often confused for a diffuse conditionadverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is wherethe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblycompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhereamt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapyothers for just about every part of your body theres a fancy name fora way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oosconditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctorsmisdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality youmay have a completely different problem always get a second opinionbefore somebody does something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomics prevention treatmentthe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reducetension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relaxif youre under a load of stress this is doubly important tune outthe world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guidingprinciple in your work every three minutes take a three second breakevery three minutes take a three second break really do it everythree minutes its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundingscalm down and relaxif you cant sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep andrelaxation are really a big dealthere are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduceinflamation and pain custommolded splints can forcefully prevent badposture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthenyour muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good postureand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hotcoldcontrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say whats bestfor you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this waswritten in the new zealand book that im lifting it almost verbatim fromappendix dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down dont flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair dont slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backwardset the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the kneesand your thighs should not slope too muchnow draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortableto work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedyis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using afootrestnow adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacebetween the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you inthe hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thisareaif you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaningback so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if availablenow i diverge a little from the texta good chair makes a big difference if you dont like your chair gofind a better one you really want adjustments for height back angleback height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get inthe way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable armrests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a goodstore and play with all these chairs pick one thats right for youin the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs thename says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacementsthere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for somepeople wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture youshouldnt be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer yourkeyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and thenlift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your handswhen your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoidpronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist padsmay or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come andlook at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax itsoften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders ordeviated handssome argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorlydesigned a number of replacements are

lee ladysubject re science and methodologyin article aprsbcssunysbedu mhollowaicsunysbedu michael holloway writesin article cjvggbnewshawaiiedu ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu lee lady writesi would also like to point out that most of the arguments about sciencein scimed scipsychology etc are not about cases where people arerejecting scientific argumentevidenceproof they are about cases whereno adequate scientific research has been done in some cases there isquite a bit of evidence but it isnt in a format to fit doctrinaireconceptions of what science is here it is again this indicates confusion between proof and the processof doing science you are making precisely one of the points i wanted to makei fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between theprocess of science and the end result as an end result of science one wants to get results that areobjectively verifiable but there is nothing objective about theprocess of science if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some meritto homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable informationbut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science thisis where you and i disagree with turpin in order to have science onemust have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a merecollection of empirically validated random hypothesesexperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science butthey are merely the culmination of scientific research the mostimportant part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing nohypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough datanor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while youre shaving orlooking out the window at least not unless youve done a lot of reallygood thinking beforehand the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocrescientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe thatthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empiricalstudies and it bothers me even more that there are many fields such ascertain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses and im especially offended by russell turpins repeated assertion thatscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoidingmistakes doesnt get you anywhere in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists

discovery stood a prior investigator mitscherlich lookingat the same phenomenon had missed a crucial detail presumably because helacked pasteurs motivation to find something that distinguished

lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies and im especially offended by russell turpins repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoiding mistakes doesnt get you anywhere i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposesabove lady seems concerned with the contrast between greatscience that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocrescience that makes smaller steps in most of this thread i havebeen concerned with the difference between what is science andwhat is not lee lady is correct when she asserts that the difference betweeneinstein and the average postdoc physicist is the quality oftheir thought but what is the difference between einstein and agenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughtsare scientifically screwy some would give velikovsky orkorzybski as examples if you dont like these choose yourown i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocrephysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi both einstein andthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from thecumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrongboth velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed todo this let me approach this from a second direction when one is askedto review a paper for a journal or conference there are manykinds of criticism that one can make one kind of criticism isthat the work is just wrong or misinformed another kind ofcriticism is that the work while technically correct is eithernot important or not interesting the first difference is theone that i have been pointing to the second difference is theone that lee lady seems to be discussing if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science this is where you and i disagree with turpin i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claimsnot just of some of its proposed remedies similarly i suspectthat traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that workwhat it lacks as one example is any experiment that tests thepresence of qi in order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypothesescertainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the goalin areas where we do not yet have this i see nothing wrong withforming and testing smaller hypotheses lets face it we cannotalways wait for an einstein to come along and make everythingclear for us sometimes those of us who are not einstein have toplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can

followed andreasonable knowlegeable people agree with the force of the logicbut people try experiments and pursue arguments for all sorts of crazyreasons irrational motivations are not just curiousities they are alarge part of the history of sciencethere are a couple of negative points to make here a theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without directverification of the existence of qi for example quarks are an acceptedpart of the standard model of physics with no direct verification whatwould be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medicalreality better than the alternatives the central theoretical claim couldlie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body ofexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any otheri wouldnt hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi thoughi dont think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much lessa theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology and itis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of ratherdirectly verifying the existence of qi science has not historically progressed in any sort of

methodology was homeopathy traditionavoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some tradeoff between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made in article aprkestreledu kingreasoningcom dick king writes somebody writes i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish auniverse in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put outthere if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove themthese are not the rules according to many who post to scimed andscipsychology according to these posters if its not supported bycarefully designed controlled studies then its not sciencetaken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific tradeunionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i dont in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless it is one of the results and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think isone of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigatequestions because they can be readily handled by the currentlyfashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutionalor corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention tothose questions which seem to have fundamental significancefor instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated withstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitativeone could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in manyareas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the papersresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questionsinto a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpinsassertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errorsi think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu ladyuhunixbitnetfrom johnfhqileafcom john

theoretical frameworks the theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done overall there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and which computations get done what keeps it going forward is the critical function of science results dont count unless they can be replicated the whole system is a sort of mechanism for generateandtest the generate part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properlyi think we agree on much however the paragraphs above seem to repeatuncritically the standard kuhnlakatosfeyerabend view of progress andrationality in science since ive addressed these issues in thisnewsgroup in the not too distant past i wont go into them again nowwhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives theimpression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhapseven the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit aroundhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies andpetty hatreds it further at least implicitly advances the position thatsciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given thecontext in which it occurs by generating in a completely nonrationaland even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are thenweeded out via the critical function of science though why this criticalfunction should be less subject to the nonrational forces is a mysteryif experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction aresubject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally trueof the application of any critical function concerning replicationthis is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes viewtrue the generation part can

the characteristics of transposons weremuch elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase wasrecognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was createdother species have different sets of transposons fortunately for mewarren and i used to eat dinner at tgi fridays all the timeit further at least implicitly advances the position thatsciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given thecontext in which it occurs by generating in a completely nonrationaland even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are thenweeded out via the critical function of scienceim not sure that its random but there is no known rational mechanismfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses if you are reallyworking in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much senseof what might or might not be true under those circumstances the bestthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have if they are wrongyou will find out soon enough but at least you will find out somethingif you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at allin mind you will probably get nowherethough why this criticalfunction should be less subject to the nonrational forces is a mysteryunfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage tononrational forces then we get varieties of pathological sciencelysenko mirskys opposition to dnaasgene cold fusion and so forthif experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction aresubject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally trueof the application of any critical function concerning replicationthis is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes viewi dont agree that this follows in fact this is exactly the point atwhich i disagree with feyerabend it is a most important part of theculture of science that one keeps ones jealousies out of the refereeingprocess failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work

polite voice consideringhow angry i felt that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings he toldme that he just doesnt have time to rap with patients and thoughtthat was what i wanted i told him that to assume i was calling torap was insulting and said again that i was just following throughon his orders he responded that he resented the implication that he felt i was making that he was not

heres your error there is no observation or hypothesis that is not taintedby theory i have a theory i make observations those observations will bemade with my theory in mind yes absolutely though id make the observation in a more general sense ofall observations are made by human beings and therefore made with variousbiases but here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back once again to equating the business of science with the end result the gizmo producedscience works very well at developing theorieswithin paradigms but is very poor at dealing with paradigm shifts if i develop a novel paradigm that explains homeopathy chinese medicine or spontaneous combustion if the paradigm is useful it will show me the wayto make observations that prove or disprove itmy point isnt so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but how you come about developing itthe paradigm of modern medicine is that the body can be reduced to a set ofessentially mechanical operations wherein disease is seen as malfunctions inthe machinery essentially the old newtonian model of the world it seemslikely that theories based upon this paradigm do not give a complete discription of the universe medicine healing etc indeed we now recognize an important psychological component to healing perhaps youd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part the topicof the philosophy of science is made for them im making them too but ithink that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science biomedical research doesnt make any basic assumptions that arent the same as any other discipline of scientificresearch that is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesisand test it modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than the old newtonian model of the world and i doubt that many psychologistswould appreciate being put outside this empirical world view psychologyalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending it is also important to distinguish reason from science science may bereasonable but so are many nonscientific methodologies aristotle reasonedthat frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle oversimplified of course but a good example this is an empirical observation it was then tested though perhaps not by aristotle and eventually found wanting in the meantime some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life theres nothing at all surprising about this its the way the gathering ofknowledge works there are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally offbaseeven idiotic to someone in the future these future people wont have cometo these relevations because they had suddenly

a damn good thing toflights of fantasy just dont have much chance of producing anything at least not in biomedical research the surest way for a graduate student toruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out hisher fantasies than with having the student work on a projectthat actually has a good chance of producing some results mds seem to be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dnaelectrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping thathed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryoticgenes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry outbinding assays the result was a wellconserved or so bp sequencethat occurs about times in the human genome unfortunately forwarrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present inso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back intothe genome on the

uses smallquantities of it for protein synthesis in the body some people have a diseaseknown as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body for them it will accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nervecells therefore it is only a major problem in young children until aroundage or so or women who

general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases by establishing links to the lyme community treating patients who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they have lyme as if they did saying that diseases such as ms are probably spirochetal if not lyme giving talks at meetings of users groups validating the feelings of even delusional patients etc this gp can go from being a runofthemill kyr gp to someone with lots of patients in the hospital and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his office and making lots of bread also getting the adulation of many who believe his is their only hope if not of cure then of control and seeing his name in publications put out by support groups etc this is a definite temptationharumph getting published in these newsletters is hardly somethingto aspire to i cant really argue with your logic though i think you may beextrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size ofone even if what you say about this local pittsburgh guy is true it isnot logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors whotreat lyme diseaseby your logic i could conclude that all of the physicians whoconsult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits tolyme patients are doing it for the money rather than because they believethey are encouraging good medicine i have no idea how sincere these guysare but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate forwhat you believe to be indiscriminate treatmenti would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issuesin

other newsletters and data related to organ transplantation and donation miketransplant recipientsinternational organizationlong island chapterpo box huntington ny newsletter april volume iv no next meetingthe next meeting is wednesday april at pm at the knights of columbus emerald manor uniondale avenue in uniondale our guest speaker will be dr lewis teperman dr teperman trained in pittsburgh under dr starzl and is now the assistant director of the liver transplant program at new york university medical center dr teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions he is a long time friend of trio surgeon to many of our members and always a gracious and delightful guest it is sure to be a very informative interesting and engaging evening our hospitality committee bette and vito suglia and jim spence will be well prepared and at last the weather should be cooperative we hope to see a very large gathering to welcome dr teperman wednesday april k of c uniondalelast meetingit has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining eveningannual meetingin addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our bylaws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board anne liver recipient and don treffeisen robert heart recipient and eulene smith vito kidney recipient and bette suglia kay grenzig liver recipient jan schichtel kidney recipient larry juliano kidney recipient david bekofsky director public education litpthose remaining on the board for another year are robert carroll liver kidney pancreas recipient jerry kidney recipient and jeanne eichhorn ron kidney donor and marie healy peter smith bone marrow recipient patricia ann yankus kidney and pancreas recipient walter ruzak kidney recipientthis may seem to be a big board but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the board therefore in addition to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also be accepted from the floor there is no set number of board members and there is plenty of work in addition brief treasurers and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring upwe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr tepermanfuture meetingsremember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year may dr

monthnotdawthe week of april is national organ and tissue donor awareness week notdaw while we are planning news releases speaking engagements and meetings with supervisors gullata and gaffney we have decided not to have our softball game because of two years experience with miserable weather we all can help spread the word on donor awareness however we have found it effective to ask your pastor or

heather writesnutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter thansugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known tofor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehydeproduced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic toliving cells all i can say is that i will not consume it aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide so a product of itshydrolysis is going to be methanol which can then be oxidized toformaldehyde the amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion ofaspartamecontaining foods are completely in the metabolic noisesince youre forming equally minute amounts of methanol from othercomponents of food all the time in studies involving administrationof high doses of the additive blood methanol levels were undetectablemethanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisoningssay ml and above this is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydeand formic acid two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelscan damage tissues like the retina and kidney because at such high dosesthe bodys detoxification system is overwhelmed interestingly onetreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk onethyl alcoholvodka or an equivalent thats because ethanol ismetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liverif the methanol stays as methanol and isnt metabolized to formaldehydeit is actually relatively nontoxic steve dyerdyerursamajorspdcccom aka imaharvardrayssdlinusmcspdccdyerfrom dyerspdcccom steve dyersubject re is msg sensitivity superstitionin article

fourfold in a single meal of processedfoods mothers milk was well below the effective dosegoodness im not saying that its good to feed infants a lot ofglutamatesupplemented foods its just that this

lee lady wrote in her previous post inthis thread gee maybe ive misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with something i say cant be all bad seriously im not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesnt use methods deemed scientific can possibly know whats true and whats not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to scimed and scipsychology according to these posters if its not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then its not sciencethese posters are making the mistake that i have previouslycriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed andcontrolled study are too narrow to apply to all investigationi think that the requirements for particular reasoning to beconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that haveoccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things toreuse the previous example we know that conclusions fromuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medicalproblems are notoriously problematic okay so lets see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement thata treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope forfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate supportin this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblebut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arequalified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testingsecondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as amathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in scipsychology andoccasionally in scimed about nlp neurolinguistic programming muchof the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized asinformal exploration than as careful scientific research for yearsnow i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tojust take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some ofthe videotapes courtesy of your local university library not forthe purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at thenlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information fromsubjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be ofscientific interest and most especially to be aware of thequestions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientificinvestigationover and over again the response i get in scipychology is if thishasnt been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empiricalresearch then it cant be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme thereve got tobe controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fastphobiatrauma curesimple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the worlds most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesnt take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim thatit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence isuseful in treating posttraumatic stress syndrome it is essentiallya variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioraltherapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique onceor in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident theprocess doesnt need to be repeated and the subject doesnt need topractice it over again at homenow to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term followup is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was donewith a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobiatrauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the thfloor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in scipsychology have a hundred and one excuses not tomake this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome studywill be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since theyre not part of thescientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobiatrauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we dont have any way of knowing that its effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in scipsychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt been described in a scientific journal its described in a number of books and ive posted articles in scipsychology describing it in as much detail as im capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but its apparently not acceptable because its adoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journalto me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so i apologize in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems

postings remind me that i had read about risks associated with the barbecuing of foods namely that carcinogens are generated is this a valid concern if so is it a function of the smoke or the elevated temperatures is it a function of the cooking elements wood or charcoal vs lava rocks i wish to know more thanks i recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and thendrips down onto the hot elementswhatever they arethat the extremeheat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or morecarcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smokethe ol professorfrom mmmcupportalcom mark robert thorsonsubject re barbecued foods and health riskthis reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today hesmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange techniqueid never seen beforehe took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foilthe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffeetable ash traymade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edgesin the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similarquantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of twoteabags of earl grey tea and a few cloveson top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer withtwo chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assemblywent on the stovetop at high heat for or minuteslater he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprisesand concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the us yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do sowrt natural wood smoke ive smoking a duck right now as it happensive noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangytaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlystopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chipsgetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking processthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chipsmy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weightstuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sortof larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time afterthe initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuffjust leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correcti also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippingon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and becauseit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grillnondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like thisduck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coalsat one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on thefloor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the firein that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coalsand yet another reason ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thatsmoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon containsnitrosamines which are carcinogenic im pretty sure this claim actuallyhas some standing dont know about the othersan amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it wasdiscovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were puttinga lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevilsthis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenicthe guy who represented the company in the press conference defendedhimself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every dayfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoalbroiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that myimmediate reaction

university guide to total nutrition stanley gershoff phd dean of tufts university school of nutrition harperperennial isbn the greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use enough caution and get burned some people suggest that the barbecuing itself is dangerous because the smoke which is absorbed by the meat contains benzopyrene which in its pure form has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals however in order to experience the same results people would have to consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a timerich young these are not kodaks

thousand times sweeter thansugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known tofor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehydeproduced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic toliving cells all i can say is that i will not consume it in the september issue of the tufts university diet and nutrition letter there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners what follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with nutrasweet reproduced without permission the controversy over aspartame began six years ago in englandwhere a group of researchers found that aspartame marketed underthe tradename nutrasweet appears to stimulate appetite andpresumably the eating of more calories in the long run than ifa person simply consumed sugar when researchers asked a groupof people to drink plain water aspartamesweetened water andsugared water they said that overall they felt hungriest afterdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage the study received widespread media attention and stirred agood deal of concern among the artificialsweetenerusing publichowever its results were questionable at best since the researchersdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite didactually translate into an increase in eating the two do notnecessarily go hand in hand in the years that followed more than a dozen studies examiningthe effect of aspartame on appetite and eating were conductedand after reviewing every one of them the director of thelaboratory of the study of human ingestive behavior at johns hopkinsuniversity barbara rolls phd concluded that consuming aspartamesweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase inthe amount of food eaten afterward one artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causingcancer is aspartame but it most certainly has been blamed for ahost of other ills since its introduction in the governmenthas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causingeverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxietystill years of careful scientific study conducted both before andafter the sweeteners entering the market have failed to confirmthat it can bring about adverse health

recognised anywhere in thesense of a disease with diagnostic criteria clear boundariesbetween it and other diseases unique pathologic or physiologicfeatures etc but here goes with what many neurologists agree onpostpolio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron diseaseby clinical examination emg and muscle biopsy the abnormalitiesare mostly chronic due to old polio but there is evidence ofongoing deterioration clinically the patients complain ofdeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasksmusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtlesscontributes to the impaired performance the examination showsmuscle weakness and atrophy the emg shows evidence of olddenervation with reinnervation giant and longduration motor unitaction

higher on depression scales ofneuropsychologic testsmy take on this im sure some will disagree after recovery fromsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles tendonsligaments bones and joints that leads to inflammatory andordegenerative conditions affecting these structures the increasingpain superimposed on the chronic but unchanging weakness leadsto progressive impairment of motor

been reducing the gene pool and defining the status of the eugenized inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the insertedgenes later became transmissible to progeny then they may

did it with theirkings without the benefits of such eugenics the race eventuallyrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused but for a whileit was a problem orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happento persons genetically altered for more menial tasks but there is nothingnew under the sun we treated slaves the same way for millennia before i see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these problems humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom touse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time thathasnt stopped the race as a whole yet many are the civilizations whichhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change however alsomany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their ownpower the ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from thefates of others and have survived by making better choices when theirturns came not that i dont think that this gene altering power couldnt wipe us offthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering nuclear power or globalwarming or whatever could and may still do that too the real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue i personally dont thinkman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off anybetter than he did the for last few we as eugenists may make it an wemay not if we dont i hope there are reservoirs of garbage people outin some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which willpull us through i believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the sameman needs

godin their hearts this is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtueneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices peoples havedied out for many reasons the societies which failed to accept enoughinput from god to safely use the power they had developed have destroyedthemselves and often others in the process it is selfevident that theones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the spiritto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakesthus far or else havent had enough power for long enough in summary i would say that the question of

turpin writes not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it doesimply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning areincapable of discovering which treatments are effective andwhich are notto start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible sotheres a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in agiven context insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completelyand makes progress impossible expenditure of sufficiently large sumsof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this on the otherhand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results whicheventually turn out to be false there is a morass of studiescontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying you people callthis science my opinion for what its worth is that one sees boththese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigorappropriate for a particular investigation i dont believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science my second point though is that highly capable people can often makeextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when usingmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards i think thisis true of many scientists and i think it is true of many who approachtheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientificwithin mathematics i think there are several examples especially beforethe twentieth century one conspicuous case is that of riemann who isfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove later mathematicians did prove them of course i think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often notso much a matter of determining what is true and whats not as it is a matter of convincing other people people have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here but i think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of ones results is anessential element not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but i think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing sciencewhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does andseems to be very successful at it i think that his judgements are alsoworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth furtherinvestigation in article cbyhdnewshawaiiedu i wrote namely is there really justification for the belief that science is a superior path to truth than nonscientific approaches admittedly my question was not at all well posed a considerableamount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as isuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer the science i was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century i certainly wasnt thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of reason and observationone thing i had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whetherin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experiencedpractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies since russell turpin seems to be much more familiar than i am withthe study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing

point massager a to order or receive a catalog call hours days orfax at notewhen i ordered the massager the item number was different and the pricewas not when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalogenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a difference in price i called them about itand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although itlooks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return thefirst one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as areason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while toship from the factory i received this one in days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable peoplei have longterm neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enoughtime lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for pt the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headachesometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the suboccipital muscles in particular the knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massagedi ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishingsomeone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and suboccipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient pt appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessaryi have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the baseunit is about a x rectangle about high with handles on eachside and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is nonremovable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counterclockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from eitherside for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neckor the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it for the neckhead the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head andor neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting orstanding applying pressure with the armswrists since my wrists arealso impaired im typing this over an extended period of time and i dont have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for mefor my back i sit in a highbacked kitchen chair position the massagerbehind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly ornot so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used homemade massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i dont pin it up first as far as im concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely ill usedo it if there are multiple considerationshassles im more likely to not bother with itnot only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on mynecksuboccipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hardagainst it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for afew days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the suboccipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for meit also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder bladesalthough again it took a few days of massaging just

thats not what id quibble about what id like to know are toricellis reasons for doing his experiment not the post hoc constructed reasons but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem it may bethis smacks a bit of ideology the supposition being that toricellissubsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical it gets dangerouslyclose to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science ifwe deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptionsof their real reasons impossible to know much about toricellis thoughts thats too bad if it is so one of rootbernsteins services to science is that he has gone rooting about in pasteurs and flemings and other peoples notes and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations pasteur

most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results one of my best came because i was mad at a colleague for a poorlywritten claim i disproved the claim of course toricellis case may be an example of a rarety where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment but turns out to be right in the endbut my point is that this type of case is not a rarity in fact i wasgoing to point to pasteur as yet another rather common example particularlythe studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation i will readilyconcede that ridiculous reasons can play an important role in howscientists spend their

riskin article cupportalcom mmmcupportalcom mark robert thorson writesthis reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today hesmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange techniqueid never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foilthe tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffeetable ash traymade by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similarquantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of twoteabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer withtwo chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assemblywent on the stovetop at high heat for or minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprisesand concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the us yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so wrt natural wood smoke ive smoking a duck right now as it happensive noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangytaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlystopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chipsgetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking processthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weightstuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sortof larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time afterthe initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuffjust leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippingon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and becauseit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grillnondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like thisduck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coalsat one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on thefloor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the firein that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thatsmoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon containsnitrosamines which are carcinogenic im pretty sure this claim actuallyhas some standing dont know about the others an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it wasdiscovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were puttinga lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevilsthis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenicthe guy who represented the company in the press conference defendedhimself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every dayfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoalbroiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that myimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoalbroiled steak would be equivalent to duncansi dont understand the assumption that because something is found tobe carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the us i think thatnaturally occuring substances excluding controlled substances arepretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additivesor other consumption its only when the chemists concoct sp aningredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everythinghow in the world do you suppose its legal

the empirical that avoidsmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previouswork lee lady writes i dont think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as amistake they fall under my definition i hope no one wouldconsider speculation thinking and informal exploration asunscientific in article cnasfmhnewshawaiiedu ladyuhunixuhcchawaiiedu lee lady writes seriously im not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at crosspurposes it is notclear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should betaken as describing what science is mainly about considerfor example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lackinga backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate andwhat is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you whatinvertebrates are all about one can read this definition andstill not know that of all animal species are invertebratesthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form thatsome invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes areubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing thedefinition of invertebrates does not tell one what they aremainly aboutthe misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficientcontext for people to understand my proposed definition okay so lets see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would onlytake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinariansthat a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk aboutabsolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talkabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and thekinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past haveproven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter ofdegree and in each field practitioners try to discover therelevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea aspsuedoscience is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportionregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claimthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and thehistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidenceare given more weight than others it is perfectly alright tospeculate i have read quite a few refereed papers thatspeculated left and right but the authors were careful toidentify the notions as speculative to list what little evidencewas presently available for them and to describe how researchcould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or touncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paperof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which theauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work itis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in scipsychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since theyre not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness whenproponents of some practice see no value in more carefulinvestigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in manyresearchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly someintersection between things that are worth investigating andthings that are advocated by those who seem careless orunreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i canunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select otherdirections for research as gordon banks has pointed out no onewants to become this generations rhine one academic in scipsychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt been described in a scientific journal i think this is absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but its apparently not acceptable because its a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journali wonder why the results were not published in my fielddissertation results are typically summarized in papers that aresubmitted to journals often the papers are

to markedly perturb theendocrine system in adults the main point is blood levelsattained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interested in seeing youprovide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articlesdisputing that msg has no effects whatsoever you mean asserting youre being intellectually dishonest or justplain confused because youre conflating reports which do not necessarilyhave anything to do with each other olneys reports would argue a potentialfor problems in human infants but thats not to say that this says

are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food food additives or other consumption its only when the chemists concoct sp an ingredient that it falls under fda regulations otherwise if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything how in the world do you suppose its legal to consume tobacco products which probably should be bannedno there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogenicfood additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in thes before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increaseddetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitudethis is why things like cyclamates and red were banned they are veryweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they arebannedthis also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember atime back in the s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so goodand never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was bannedthis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leavesif it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someonewould do it in order to make money the

useful overview of alternative health therapies the russian engineer semyon kirlian and his wife valentina during the s using alternating currents of high frequency to illuminate their subjects they photographed them they found that if an object was a good conductor such as a metal the picture showed only its surface while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner structure of the object even if it were optically opaque they found too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead and living objects dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones were subject to changes the objects life activity was also visible in highly variable colour patterns high frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in the soviet union but only a few people in the west have taken it up seriously professor douglas dean in new york and professor philips at washington university in st louis have produced kirlian photographs and others have been produced in brazil austria and germany using kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around peoples fingers notably around those of healers who are concentrating on healing someone normally blue and white rays emanate from the fingers but when a subject becomes angry or excited the aura turns red and spotty the soviets are now using kirlian photography to diagnose diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method they argue that in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person isnt actually ill but is about to be they claim to be able to foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase but the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by kirlian photography is the phantom effect during high frequency photography of a leaf from which a part had been cut the photograph gave a complete picture of the leaf with the removed part showing up faintly this is extremely important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can see the legs of amputees as if they were still there the important thing about the kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern cant possibly represent a secondary phenomenon or the field would vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished the energy grid contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than the actual object itself kirlian photography has shown how water mentally charged

foundation whose goals are to provide support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a newsletter enhance awareness of rrp at the local and national level and aid in the prevention cure and treatmentsince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to those viruses causing warts they feel a cure would be within reach if money were available for research because rrp is rare it not only gets scant attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure part of the rrp foundations mission is to change that anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale please call marlene or bill at monetary donations can be made at the foundations booth during communiversity april th to pm in downtown princeton or sent directly

cqopxmqencorecom sheffnerencorecom steve heffner writesa bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin wasdiscovered it had produced a dull pain in that area the herniawas repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and aplug and patchi suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopicnow the pain occurs more often my gp couldnt identify anyspecific problem the surgen who performed the original procedurenow says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and hesaid that he has to cut into the area for the repair this timemy question to the net is there a nonintrusive method todetermine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is fromsomething elseby far the still best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashionedphysical examination if you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about byincreasing intraabdominal pressuresometimes is not that obvious the hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previousoperation i cant tell you the person that examined you is in the bestposition to make that determinationare there noninvasive ways of diagnosing a hernia every now and then folks write about ct scans and ultrasounds for this but these are fartoo expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining fingerhoward doyledoylepittedufrom mednusunixnussg wansaicheong khinlinsubject re lasers for dermatologistsit is not true that dermatologists gave not

is an overall righthandedness in the population i mean do most people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the other if so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this there is eye dominance same as handedness and usually for the same side it has nothing to do with refractive error however i recall readingseeing that former baseball star chris chambliss hitting abilities were in part attributed to a combination of lefthandedness righteye dominance i was part of a study a few years ago at the university of arizona tosee whether cross dominant individuals those with a particular handednessbut who had dominance in the opposite eye were better hitters thanthose with same side dominance of hand and eye i was picked frommy softball class because i was cross dominant right hand left eyewhich put me in a small minority and the grad student was trying to getan equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people tocontrol the study she used a pitching machine fast pitch sincei was used to slow pitch i didnt come close actually i thinki foul tipped a few to hitting the ball if there were a lot of peoplelike me in her study ie those who cant hit fast pitch or arenot used to hitting off a machine i would seriously question theresults of that study i think there have been some studies of majorleague players across a fairly large cross section of players to testwhether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was better but i dont know the results the woman who ran the study i was insaid that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance

when we put one and one together it can be safely assumed thatmsg may cause some allergic reactions in some peoplestick with natural things msg doesnt do body any good and possiblyharms for that matter so why bother with it taste food as it shouldbe tasted and dont cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of msgas i understood it msg is natural isnt it found in tomatoesanyway lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of naturalthings peanuts onions tomatoes milk etc just because somethingis natural doesnt mean it wont cause problems with some folksas for how foods taste if im not allergic to msg and i likethe taste of it why shouldnt i use it saying i shouldnt useit is like saying i shouldnt eat spicy food because my neighborhas an ulcerpeople have long modified the taste of

disorder from anyone who might have recently been effected by it from being associated with it or actually having this disorder and help me find out where i can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internetrecently i had a baby boy born with seizures which occured hoursafter birth he was immediately transferred to a major hospital in bostonand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his conditionthis has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only inlearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing withhospitals proceduresetci dont want to go into a lot of detail but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weightas a normal baby would he was put on the standard anticonvulsion drugsand that did not seem to help out his mri ekg catscans are all normalbut the eegs show alot of seizure activity after many metabolic testsbody structure tests and infectionvirus tests the doctors still do notknow quite what type of siezures he is having although they do have alotof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms this is wherewe stand right nowif anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as i mentioned up aboveany information relating to this disorder i would sure appreciate hearingfrom you i am not trying to play doctor here but only

realize thatsuch toxins can cause problems in some people in my case it was sinussince thats the center of my allergic response of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i wasfrom over years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of thestress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeastcolonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer sincetesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has totake an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relativelysafe unlike past

cupportalcommmmcupportalcom mark robert thorson writes i dont understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that it would not be legal in the us i think thatno there is something called the delany amendment which makes carcinogenicfood additives illegal in any amount this was passed by congress in thes before stuff like mass spectrometry became available which increaseddetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitudethis is why things like cyclamates and red were banned they are veryweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats so under the act they arebannedthis also applies to natural carcinogens some of you might remember atime back in the s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so goodand never tasted so good again that was the time when safrole was bannedthis is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leavesif it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days someonewould do it in order to make money the fact that no one does it indicatesthat enforcement is still in effectan odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo filethis is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves thisis not only a natural product but a natural product still in its naturalform so maybe thats how they evade delany or maybe a special exemptionwas made to appease powerful louisiana

recently listened to a tape by dr stanislaw burzynski in which he claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anticancer properties that he names antineoplastons burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the united states despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical trialswhat is the generally accepted opinion of dr burzynskis research he paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment but i have no basis from which to judge his claims two weeks ago however i read that the nihs department of alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynskis work their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldnt investigate a treatment that didnt seem promisingany

my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms after the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain at this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue while attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured nerve which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly controlled by tylenol s and some loss of use of the arm palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement with great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm this was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased the doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed tylenol and soon morphine to relieve the pain she has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term my questions are has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated please respond by email because i do not always get chance to read this group if anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that i should

beginning for hisprogramyeah ill bet tomorrow the worldlisten uncontrolled studies like this are worthlessin my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classicsymptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book eg extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc whichi never had before started in november within one week of full dosageof sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i cannow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes im alsogreatly improved in other areas as wellim sure you are you sound like the typical hysterichypochondriac whoresponds to miracle curesof course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic tomolds yeasts etc it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out thatif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have anatural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where youwould have perceptible symptomsyeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriouslysnortalso yeast do produce toxins of varioussorts and again you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize thatsuch toxins can cause problems in some peopleyeah it sounds reasonable to meof course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i wasfrom over years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of thestress of infections and allergies etcoh really what tests immunecompromised my assmore like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndromecan develop excessive yeastcolonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer sincetesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has totake an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relativelysafe unlike past antifungals still have to be careful however so theresno reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasonsyou know its a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misusedin this way its ridiculously expensive and potentially toxicthe trouble is that it isnt toxic enough so it gets abused by quacksbtw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphaetoo deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect youll finda lot of people who are on nystatin all the timethe only good thing about nystatin is that its relatively cheapand when taken orally nontoxic but oral nystatin is without anysystemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be withoutany effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first useiv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solvethe yeast problem once and for allin summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keepmedicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmlyto the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enoughactually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to myface that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i

baffsubject getting aids from acupuncture needles someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupuncture needlesunless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has aidsit is unlikely not impossible they will get aids from acupuncture needles generally even if accidently inoculated the normalimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion most acupuncturists use disposable needlesuse once and throw away they do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this routeso its good business to advertise disposable needlesused here these needles tend to be of a lower quality however being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion they tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles if i choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments the risk here for hepatitis hiv etc transmission is that i could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patientbut clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snagsand hematomasso i use them acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknessesbut they are all solid when compared to their injectionstyle cousins in china herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have tcm physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine this meansthinkingtinythat a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical shot when the skin is puntured on the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that havent been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior of course in tcmthe bodys exterior is protected by the wei protective qiso infection is unlikelyor in other wordsthere is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture sitewhile im fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion i would like to know for what complaint they have consulted

by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culturepositivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culturepositivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drugrelated sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drugresistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis the cdh stdaids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year per objective a race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for

states and source mmwr date apr motorvehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than million years of potential life lost before age annually child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss from through all states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated motorvehicle crashrelated injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among us children while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age usage for those aged years aged years and aged years in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children to characterize the association between adult safetybelt use and adultreported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than years within a household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during and this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for respondents aged greater than or equal to years in states that participated in brfss a populationbased randomdigitdialed telephone survey and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents had a child aged less than years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the childs age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safetybelt use in this analysis were consistent use ie always buckle up and less than consistent use ie almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than each of the states had some type of child restraint law of these six arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia had no law requiring adults to use safety belts four idaho maryland pennsylvania and washington had a secondary enforcement mandatory safetybelt law ie a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued and one state new york had a primary enforcement mandatory safetybelt law ie vehicles could be stopped for a safetybelt law violation alone in nine states childpassenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april laws included all children aged less than years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into those having a law requiring adult safetybelt use law states and those without such a law nolaw states overall of children aged less than years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than chisquare test in law states than in nolaw states versus and versus respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safetybelt use figure adults with consistent use reported high rates of childoccupant restraint use regardless of the childs age range for yearolds to for yearolds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safetybelt use the rate of childoccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range for yearolds to for yearolds when comparing children of consistent adult safetybelt users with children of less than consistent adult safetybelt users confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups ie aged less than and year reported childoccupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in nolaw states regardless of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safetybelt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risktaking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motorvehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupantprotection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through healthcare facilities that serve lowincome communities or through federal programs ie head start that are directed at parents with young children injuryprevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safetybelt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group characterized by

on data for for births in california and births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocationdysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidneyureter and scoliosislordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of armhand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for differences in armhand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus

throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza ahn predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only of identified viruses were influenza ahn but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the season during the season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and ahn but not influenza ahn interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains ahn and b during the season emphasizes the

reproductive technologiesfollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilizationembryo transfer ivfet baby in a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivfet gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the hightech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease andor pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivfet gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future areas of researchin addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sexlinked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky phdassociate professor and director of researchdepartment of obstetrics and gynecologycollege of medicine university of arizonatucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertilitythe following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for or days before they are transferred to the patients uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computerhicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivfet or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse andor gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivfet is accomplished with eggs obtained in nonstimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasoundguided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivfet exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis andor mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivfet nationwide has stabilized at about percent per cycle results from our program involving patients who have undergone ivfet cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivfet cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over years and provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this hightech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivfet involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of eggstube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility andor idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for through indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivfet technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is to percent and for ivfet to percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivfet however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivfet procedure between january and december we have performed a total of gift cycles with an overall success rate of percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from nontransferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than million spermml in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm andor less than percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of subzonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs worldwide indicate that only to percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky

earlier than was previously believed anthony fauci director of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid said we must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance he said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds fauci who coauthored one of the two papers published last week in nature rejects the argument by one of his coauthors cecil fox that the new discovery indicates that billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly john tew of the medical college of virginia in richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of hivinfected patients aids activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph tissue weve known about this for five years but were glad it is now in the public domain said jesse dobson of the californiabased project

right april risk of aids virus from doctors found to be minimal washington post p a the risk of hiv being transmitted from infected healthcare professionals to patients is minimal according to new research published in todays journal of the american medical association jama this finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting hiv from a health care worker is remote three studies in the jama demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two hivpositive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus the studies were conducted by separate research teams in new hampshire maryland and florida each study started with an hivpositive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate the new hampshire study found that none of the patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an hivpositive orthopedic surgeon contracted hiv in maryland of patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at johns hopkins

health care agency santa ana calif and the emory university school of public health in atlanta ga respectively dr berkleys editorial on why american doctors should care about the aids epidemic beyond the united states details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and hivaids in particular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in the balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world if enacted this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health aids and priorities in the global village in reply journal of the american hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april medical association vol no p berkley seth every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york ny in reply to a letter by drs gellert and nordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aids and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly costeffective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the

children who now face the certainty they will develop aids anthony s fauci md director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick if these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials the centers for disease control and prevention estimates children in the united states have hiv by the end of the decade

anticipates conducting the trial at nine actg sites around the country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hivspecific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april stimulate new ones it will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease the results from the pediatric trial known as actg will be examined closely for other reasons as well this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines said daniel hoth md director of niaids division of aids we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children in the united states most hivinfected children live in poor innercity areas and more than percent are minorities mainly black or hispanic nearly all hivinfected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults the most recent information suggests that percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aidsrelated infection by to years of age these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays at least half of the children in the trial will be years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants all volunteers must have welldocumented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a

independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although the hiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass this problem scientists have developed hivtransgenic mice which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wartlike tumors on their necks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans no skin lesions developed in their normal nontransgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wartlike skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a proteinproducing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr peter dickie who is now with the national institute of allergy and

us department of health and human services march hhs secretary donna e shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv infection or aids the tollfree national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist it provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital secretary shalala said one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks currently many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience secretary shalala said this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available the telephone number for health care professionals is and it is accessible from am to pm est am to pm pst monday through friday during these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an hour at other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as possible health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing hiv care including the latest hivaids drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information the service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials when a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with hivrelated diseases the consultant asks for patientspecific information including cd cell count current medications sex age and the patients hiv history this national service has grown out of a month local effort that hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april responded to nearly calls from health care providers in northern california the initial project was funded by hrsas bureau of health professions through its community provider aids training cpat project and by the american academy of family physicians when providers expand their knowledge they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients said hrsa administrator robert g harmon md mph this project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the hivaids patients they serve this service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on hiv care management said hrsas associate administrator for aids and director of the bureau of health resources development g stephen bowen md mph providers who treat people with hiv or aids have access to the latest information on new drugs treatment methods and therapies for people with hiv or aids hrsa is one of eight us public health service agencies within hhs

have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal

introduction despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early s the us public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes eg escherichia coli oh hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings eg hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the us healthcare system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs this issue of mmwr introduces a new series emerging infectious diseases future articles will address these diseases as well as surveillance control

diseases br div of bacterial and mycotic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli oh is a pathogenic gramnegative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli oh that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli oh often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli oh in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli oh using smac agar when infections with e coli oh are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli oh lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the us department of agricultures food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli oh entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli oh and for hus to better define the

linked to serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattlebased study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz phd of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of pm exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as micrograms the authors concluded that for every microgram increase in the fourday average of pm the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung associations medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery phd of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april acid aerosols researchers cant put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through populationbased research like the seattle study given that the epas current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and thats rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm doesnt have to be near its

incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late s and the s it was the national cancer act of that authorized the establishment of new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in there were comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer centers operations these criteria encompass strong participation in ncidesignated highpriority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activitiesall of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april of the ncidesignated cancer centers are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing populationwide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the ncidesignated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from

to test multiple aids vaccines instead of only allowing the army to test a single vaccine administration sources said thursday the decision ends the controversy between army aids researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by microgenesys inc and the national institutes of health which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested health and human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday companies including genentech inc chiron corp and immuno ag have already told nih that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests the testing is intended to demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of hiv in patients already infected shalala refuted last weeks reports that the clinton administration had decided the armys test of the microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time the report was inaccurate and i expect there to be some announcement in the next hours about that particular aids research project said shalala administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr bernadine healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had convinced the white house that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously but microgenesys president frank volvovitz said a test of multiple

the most widely used drug to fight aids since it was approved by the food and drug administration in burroughs wellcome the manufacturer of azt made million last year alone from sales of the drug however a team of european researchers recently reported that although hivpositive patients taking azt demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing aids within the first year of treatment that benefit disappeared two years later the lancet published preliminary findings of the threeyear study which could give more reason for critics to argue the drugs cost side effects and general efficacy even though us researchers concede the study was more comprehensive than american trials many argue the european researchers suggestion that hivpositive patients experience little improvement in their

wasnt gettingany rest my doctor said that was a common reaction if astemizoledoesnt cross the bloodbrain barrier how does it cause that sideeffect any ideasit made me really bitchy for the first few weeks now that i think aboutit i was having some bizarre dreams too my doctor said it made him feellike he had to be doing something all the time but if you keep taking itafter a few weeks these

indurkhya tutorial programtutorials will be conducted at the bethesda ramada hotel on tuesday july pm introduction to molecular biology for computer scientists prof mick noordewier rutgers universitythis overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches dr noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biologypm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corpan overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop codeveloper of ariadne and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industrypm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratory this tutorial will cover the most rapidlyexpanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and informationtheoretic views of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoretical division at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domainpm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford universitythe genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly nonlinear multidimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm genetic programming an extension wellsuited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taught this subject since and is the author of a standard text in the fieldpm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann instituteapproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness dr searls who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn represents the branch of this field that considers higherorder syntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel

is from a critique of a minutes presentation on msg which was aired on november rd the critique comes from the tufts diet and nutrition letter february edited for brevitychances are good that if you watched minutes last novemberrd you came away feeling msg is bad for you inthe segment entitled no msg for instance show host ed bradleymakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating themmillions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violentlysick peppers his report with sensational but clinically unprovenpersonal testimony and speaks of studies on msg that make thesubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies areconsider his making reference at the beginning of the program toa study conducted at the eastern virginia medical school in orderto back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that msga flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well asin many supermarket items causes headaches what he does notmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not onhumans but on rabbitsone of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologistpatricia williams phd says it certainly is conceivable thata small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get headaches from it but she explains the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problema second lapse comes with mention of dr john olney a professorat the washington university school of medicine who mr bradleyremarks says that his years of research with laboratoryanimals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters becauseit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage dr olneysresearch with lab animals does not show anything about humanyoungstersin fact only under extreme circumsrtances did dr olneys experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injectedextremely high doses of msg into rodents completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directlyand when he used tubes to forcefeed huge amounts of the substanceto very young animals on an empty stomach of course neitherof those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in msg with food and most of what they take in is broken down byenzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very littlereaches the bloodstream much to little in fact for humanblood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentrationsfound in dr olneys lab animalsthe world health organization appears to be very much aware ofthat fact and so does the european communities scientificcommittee for foodboth after examining numerous studieshave concluded that msg is safetheir determination makes sense considering that msg has neverbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributedto it headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and aburning sensation among others in fact the most failsafeof clinical studies the doubleblind study has consistentlyexonerated the muchmaligned substancethats quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component ofmonosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems wheneverwe eat any food that contains protein the reason is that oneof the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is brokendown into glutamate during digestionits a breakdown that occurs frequently glutamic acid is themost abundant of the or so amino acids in the diet it makesup about percent of the protein in flesh foods percent inmilk percent in corn and percent in whole wheatthat doesnt mean its entirely unimaginable that a small numberof people have trouble metabolizing

justified in being pissed off at this doctor last saturday evening my year old son cut his finger badly with a knife i took him to a local urgent and general care clinic at pm the clinic was open till pm the receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at and did not want to be delayed here during the next few minutes in response to my questions with several trips to the back room the receptionist told me the doctor was doing paperwork in the back the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going to the emergency room the doctor would not even speak to me she would not tell me the doctors name or her own name when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said i dont know i realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but i was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered my son did get three stitches at the emergency room speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center the abovebehavior is completely inappropriate if a patient who requires extensivecare shows up at the last minute we always see them and give them appropriatecare it is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of itsposted hours but what you describe is misbehavior ask to speak to theclinic director

banschbachvmsocomokstateedusubject candidayeast bloom fact or fictioni can not believe the way this thread on candidayeast has progressedsteve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relieflike elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i couldnt help elaine or jonbut somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack ive been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw firsthand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical schoolswitched to the vegan diet typically this is about of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class thats okay because i know that some of what im teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the us its really too bad that most us medical schools dont cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the medical professionin animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi systemmouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barriersteve got real upset with elaines doctor because he was using antifungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would notor at least should not be calling elaines doctor a quackhere is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsiblefor this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeastlike fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasiscandidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposingfactor is present such as a high blood glucose leveldiabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in its foodfuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isnt certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat itif its internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tractmouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all americans die with less vitamin a than they were born withus autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the antifungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriate just as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer saysbut even in patients being given the antifungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressedlack of a good bacterial flora in the body andor poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from its name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophilius is the predominate bacteriaunless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positivescandida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes its nice to know that i dont have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quackcandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a womans period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tracti would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for antifungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problemrecurring vaginal yeast infections this md did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an md with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a nonexistent syndromethe nonpathogenic bacteria l acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranesbut before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the bcomplex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistent disordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose its not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gutif steve and some of the other naysayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin a and antifungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the

uabdpodpouabeduspamdomuabedu uabdpodpouabedugila stephen holland writesin article rgfinneceticsuncedu jgecsuncedu john eyleswrote a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohns disease but she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the problems of people with crohns disease if she is having problems with fresh vegetables the guess is that thereis some obstruction of the intestine without knowing more it is notpossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarringor temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine in general there areno dietary limitations in patients with crohns except as they relateto obstruction there is no evidence that any foods will bring on recurrence of crohns interesting statements simply because i have been told otherwise imcertainly not questioning steves claims as for one i am not a doctor and iagree that foods dont bring on the recurrence of crohns but inflammationcan be either mildly or drastically enhanced due to foodhaving had one major obstruction resulting in resection is that a good enoughcaveat i was told that a low residue diet is called for basicallythe idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut which may not berealized by the patient any residue in the system can be caught in the foldsof inflammation and constantly irritate thus exacerbating the problemtherefore anything that doesnt digest completely by the point of commoninflammation should be avoided with what ive been told is typical crohnsof the terminal ileum my diet should be low residue consisting ofcompletely out never again itemso corn kernel husk doesnt digest most of us know this

rds for dietary help if you can get your friends physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for the rds services just like the services of a physical therapist the better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends plan doesnt it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining healcrohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but im not aware of tea or turmeric containing

misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but beingthe phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few peoplemyself in past posts lets all try to raise the level of this discussionabove the level of anal effluenthumans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrierin my welldescribed situation in prior posts i definitely was immunestressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinuseswere a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damagedi also was on antibiotics times in years in the end even two weeksof ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterialinfection of the sinuses via catscans mucus color wont get into thedetails and other symptoms three very traditional ents made thisdiagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of thedifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showeda bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help youunderstand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox antifungaltherapy belowthe first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poormucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without beingconsidered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetweeninfectionsteve got real upset with elaines doctor because he was using antifungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would notor at least should not be calling elaines doctor a quacki was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor aftermy blood tests put me on iu of vitamin a for one week only thendropped it down to iu for the next couple of weeks i also receivedzinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairlycomplex ways as my doctor explained hes one of those evil orthomolecularspecialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normalhe then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multivitaminsupplement and made sure that i maintain a iuday of beta carotenecall me carrot face hopefully elaines doctor will take a similar careful approach and toall supplements im even reevaluating some supplements im taking forexample niacin in fairly large dosages gramday which steve dyer hadgood information about on scimednutrition if niacin only has secondorderimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably isnot worth taking such a large dose longterm and risking liver damagesurvives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in though i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox thati definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in mysinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies thatdemonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritationsinusitisrhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after oneweek of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thistime i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting onsporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considerednormalbtw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry cantremember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the swhich stated that people can develop contained nonlethal or nonseriousaspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinusinflammation symptoms ill have to dig out that reference again since itis relevant to this discussionsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isnt certainmy doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergicresponse to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positiveanother question would everybody show the same strong positive so this testis essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can growpartway into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy tocandida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membraneirritation due to the bodys allergic response as i said in an earlier postone does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a md degree or a phd in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesisbtw and ill repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survivalhas routinely given before anything else nizoral a presporanox systemicantifungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronicsinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times inthe last two years he claims that out of or so patients well over notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but itdoesnt cure it by any means implying the socalled yeastfungus infectionis not the primary cause but a later complication hes also found thatnystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not helpthis implies of course assuming that excessive yeastfungus bloom isaggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeastfungus has grown partwayinto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeastfungus other than bydirect contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admitlots of ifs and implies which doesnt please the hardcore nt whohas to have the doubleblind study or its a nonissue but one has to startwith some plausible hypothesisexplanation a strawman if you willif its internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denyand reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until theappropriate studies are done and that is if you cant observe or culturethe yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then theres no way to diagnose oreven recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtuallyimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannotbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the bodyits a real catchanother catch those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say thatno studies have been done actually studies have been done but if its notup to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a nonstudy whichshould not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies shouldbe done and that will take big to do it right however in order toconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their walletsyou literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence tocompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studyneeded funding that is you have to do of the study before you even getfunding as a scientist at a national lab im very aware of this for thesmaller funded projects im afraid that even if dr ivker and otherdoctors got together pooled their practices case histories and anecdotesinto a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would getnowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical resultsit is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they havedecided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tonoticeable nonlethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenablehypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidenceto the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they wouldalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds its a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not willnot and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who holdsuch a viewpoint kind of reminds me of listercandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tractmouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all americans die with less vitamin a than they were born withus autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom arent there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of thesinus mucus membranes and ciliawhile diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the antifungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriate just as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer saysagain the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeastfungusspecies can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growingin bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does butyou cant kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemicantifungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones suchas nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as hasbeen pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor ive been inemail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the longterm treatment of gi tract candidiasis its like trying to weed a gardenby cutting off whats above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comeout again once you walk awaythe question is whether a contained candida bloom can partiallygrow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptomsin susceptible people eg allergy without becoming systemic in theclassical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessivebloom not causing any problems and the fullblown systemic infection thatis potentially lethalin the gi system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like ive been diagnosed in a priorpost that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positivescandida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes its nice to know that i dont have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quackas ive said in private email there are flaws in our current medical systemthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attemptalternative therapies after the approvedprovenaccepted therapies dont workfor example i went to three ents who all said that i will just have to livewith my acutechronic sinusitis after the abs failed they did mentionsurgery to open up the ostia but my ostia werent plugged and it would notget to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive andfairly nonstandard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring andequalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastlyimproved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deterioratedof course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would haveimproved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of theexperience of the three ents i saw who said that id just have to live withit im confident i will reach what one could call a total cure theantifungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that directionbecause of my overuse of abs for the last four years note for thosehaving sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention abovebe sure to get the revised editioni have often wondered what an md with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a nonexistent syndromedr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and hisvisits to several ents totally floored him when they said youll just haveto live with it he spent several years trying everything standard andnonstandard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he nowshares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the roadto recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take asystemic antifungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history ofantibiotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his ownpractice im sure if i commented to him of the hardcore beliefs of the antiyeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such asits worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildlyi also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatingtheir moral obligations to help the patientmaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and areconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypotheticalyeast overgrowth eg they fit some of the profiles the proyeast peoplehave identified should consider antifungal therapy if all other avenueshave been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor doessomething nonstandard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over athousand of his patients shouldnt you at least sit up and take noticemaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it worksinstead of why it shouldnt work im afraid a lot of doctors have becomeso enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patientsthey have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced whichwe dont see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point whenyou just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approachsuch as trying a good systemic antifungal such as sporanox after havingexhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditionalmedical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing iwent to a couple of doctors who are somewhat outside this establishmentand as a result i have found significant reliefwould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set upsome kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or havinghis license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubttherapies for hisher patients that finally reach the point where all theaccepted therapies are ineffective id like to hear a doctor tell mewell ive tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thiscountry and since they clearly dont work for you i now have the authorityto use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others icant promise anything and there are some risks you will have to signsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature ofthese unproven therapies and ill have to register your case at the stateboard anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i wouldve jumped on thispronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruisticreasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with muchrisk to himher risk meaning losing their license and possibly to thepatient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicineand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also wouldbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thecompassion of the medical community to the patient that its doing everythingit can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanismthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some ofwhich seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at alltrue quackeryi better get off my soapbox before this post reaches k in sizeif taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranesbut before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the bcomplex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistent disordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapywhat dosage of b appears to be necessary to promote the healing and properworking of the mucos memebranessome of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose its not going to out grow the bacteria and you

usually given intra muscularly use a thin needle guage and select a spot on the upper outer thigh no major nerves or blood vessels there clean the area with antiseptic before injection and after make sure to inject deeply a different kind of pain is felt when the needle enters the muscle contrasted to the prick when it pierces the skin ps try to go to a doctor selftreatment and selfinjection should be avoided as far as possible the areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little fat i inject on my legs and gut and prefer the gut i can stickit in at a degree angle and barely feel it im not fat justhave a little gut my legs however are muscular and i have to pinchto get anything and then i inject at about a degree angleand itstill hurts the rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections howeverso if its a daily thing it would bebest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey althoughsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot to prevent irritation when you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep wait for it to dry somewhat or you may get the alcohol in thepuncture and of course that doesnt feel good a way to preventirratation is to mark the spot that you injected a good way todo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot this helps prevent you from injecting in the same spotand spacing the sites out accuartely about apartthis is from experience so i hope itll help you i havediabetes and have to take an injection every morninglaterdavid david hahnuniversity of wisconsin

seeing her every weeks for the past few months im at week and during the last visits ive gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands ive thus far gained pounds also she says that though im at weeks the babys size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the babys size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and ive had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway thats of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasnt eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasnt as much of a problemso the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but im still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken wo skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet eg bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i cant even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed im concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if im not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if shes concerned about fat im not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i cant seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and shes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like im being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this nonfat diet i would understand if she had said lowfat diet since im trying that anyway even if she said really lowfat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a highfat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation im not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated im truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my

apraiojscnasagovspenserfuddjscnasagov s spenser aden wrote interesting statements simply because i have been told otherwise im certainly not questioning steves claims as for one i am not a doctor and i agree that foods dont bring on the recurrence of crohns but inflammation can be either mildly or drastically enhanced due to foodthe feeling obout this has changed in the gi community the currentfeelingis that inflammation is not induced by food there is even evidence thatpatients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulationofintestinal growth factors there is now interest in providing smallamountsof nasogastric feeding to patients on iv nutrition but i digress symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food but not inflammation having had one major obstruction resulting in resection is that a good enough caveat i was told that a low residue diet is called for basically the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut which may not be realized by the patient any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate thus exacerbating the problem therefore anything that doesnt digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided with what ive been told is typical crohns of the terminal ileum my diet should be low residue consisting of completely out never again items o corn kernel husk doesnt digest most of us know this o popcorn same o dried dehydrated fruit and fruit skins o nuts very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge the low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructionsagain it is not felt that food causes inflammation these foods areavoided because they may get stuck id go ahead and have thefudge though discouraged greatly o raw vegetables too fibrous o wheat and raw grain breads o exotic lettuce iceberg is ok since its apparently mostly water o greens turnip mustard kale etc o little seeds like sesame try getting an arbys without it o long grain and wild rice husky o beans youll generate enough gas alone without them o basically anything that requires heavy digestive processing i was told that the more processed the food the better rather ironic in this day and age the whole point is preventative you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible i was told that among the numerous things that were heavily discouraged i only listed a few to try the ones i wanted and see how i felt if its bad dont do it again remember though that this was while i was in remission for veggies cook the daylights out of them i prefer steaming i think its cooks more thoroughly youre mileage may vary as with anything else check with your doctor dont just take my word but this is the info ive been given and it may be a starting point for discussion good luck spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant andinformed patient would that many patients be able to tell whatcauses them problems the digestive processing idea is changing butif a food causes problems avoid them be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause crohnscommonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up withseverly restricted diets that take months to renormalizethere was a good article in the ccfa newsletter recently that discussedthe issue of dietary restriction of

in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate productiontoxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation im going to state it again herebut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b supplements read on to find out whyi have my asbestos suit on now guysvitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above grams per day review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycine also forms oxalic aciddamino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol to mg of b each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci patients receiving at least mg b each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levelsfor gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activityb is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deaminationdamino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin cabove grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic productionproc soc exp biol med intakes of grams per day up to grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from mg per day up to mg per day until grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only to mg per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and gram dose grams jumped it to mg over the average excretion before supplementation and grams jumped it to mg over the average before supplementationb is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b that we dont know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b differences in b levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challengethis is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b some researchers believe that the main cause of calciumoxalate kidney stones is b deficiencyespecially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing to mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalateurol int if mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretionhere are the high oxalate foods beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least mggrams beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain to mggramsif the threshold is mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent nengj med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b you shouldnt have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b is mg per day for males and mg per day for femalesdirectly related to protein intakeb can be toxicnerve damage if it is consumed in doses of mg or more per day for an extended peroidweeks to months the usda food survey done in had an average intake of mg per day for males and mg per day for females living in the us coupled with this low intake was a high protein dietwhich greatly increases the b requirement as well as the presence of some of the different drugs that either block b absorption are metabolic antagonists of b or promote b excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcoholisoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b requirementthis would be on top of your dietary intake of b any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation

commission or omission healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering some have stuck to standard approved proceduresothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that it will help the patient the key has to be tied to the healers oath i will do no harm but you know david that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient the job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed each physician deals with this riskbenefit paradox a little differently some are very conservative while others are more agressive an agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patients health and not an attempt to rake in lots of moneythrough some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases i dont see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethicalwhat do i reserve the term quack for pseudomedical professionals these people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into their lair some of these individuals are really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine but many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a few fast bucks while a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a

can figure out how the poisoner gets theheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a realstory herecome to think of it would continue even after the heavy water wasno longer being

reputable idealist responsible for my opinionsfrom aldridgenetcomcom jacquelin aldridgesubject re cholistasisspfatfree dietpregnancyheartaccessdigexcom g writeshiive just returned from a visit with my obgyn and i have a few concerns that maybe yall can help me with ive been seeing her every weeks for the past few months im at week and during the last visits ive gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands ive thus far gained pounds also she says that though im at weeks the babys size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the babys size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and ive had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway thats of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasnt eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasnt as much of a problemso the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but im still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken wo skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet eg bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i cant even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed im concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if im not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if shes concerned about fat im not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i cant seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and shes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like im being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this nonfat diet i would understand if she had said lowfat diet since im trying that anyway even if she said really lowfat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a highfat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation im not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated im truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and ill end up having to eat constantly thus far i dont find any foods satisfyingthanks gfor one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if itchanges anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories where before youhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwavecooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat itshard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta orrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybesmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is thebaby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs howtight are your clothes you shouldnt be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again itwill put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides backand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactiveeasier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the babyturn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last monthswhen you are shortwaisted its easy for that baby to end up right under thediaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had mysecond one to do over again i think id have tried to loosen up since hedidnt turn sideways until late and the relief was enormousmaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybeshe just nags all her patients this way especially if shes young but this gallbladderwhatever problem that might be coming up is somethingto be avoided if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy myfirst pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little troublesome articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically betterchance of carrying their baby grain of salt here

have evacuated by the un this week to his home town of tuzlathe muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment ofthe horrors of the yearlong serb siege of srebrenica and thesuffering of the thousands trapped there i lived through hell together with the people ofsrebrenica all those who lived through this are the greatestheroes that humanity can produce he told reporters mujanovic had practiced for two months as an assistantat a local hospital in tuzla but before going to srebrenica hehad never performed a surgical operation on his own now he sayshe has performed major surgery times relying on books forguidance amputating arms and legs times usually withoutanesthetic delivering babies and performing four cesareansections he worked tohour days slept in the hospital for thefirst weeks after his arrival last aug and treated patients he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot fromtuzla miles northwest of srebrenica about other peoplecarried in supplies and soldiers guided and protected himthrough guerrilla terrain he said his worst memory was of days ago when seven serb shellslanded within one minute in an area half the size of a footballfield killing people immediately and wounding half ofthe dead were women and children the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and thechildren were playing soccer there was no warning theblood flowed like a river in the street he said there were pieces of women all around and you could notpiece them together one woman holding her two children in herhands was lying with them on the ground dead they had noheads before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions weredeplorable he said many deaths could have been prevented hadthe hospital had surgical tools facilities and medicine the six general practitioners who had been operating beforehe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did theydidnt know the basic principles for amputating limbs once he arrived the situation improved he said but bymidseptember he had run out of supplies bandages were washed and boiled five times sometimesthey were falling apart in my hands he said doctors had noanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the painbecause it increased bleeding people were completely conscious during amputations andstomach operations he said blood transfusions wereimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types i felt destroyed psychologically mujanovic said the situation improved after dec when a convoy arrivedfrom the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened inmiddecember after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in theregion every day we had air strikes and shellings then the hunger set in between middecember and midmarch

ive gottenlots of recipes off the net that dont use additivesif you like additives then get off the net and go to your localsupermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipes are not very good or the food is poor quality yes and you buy it says something about your taste ehi dont and what happens when the companies forced to submit to

to buy food that costs morebut does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbookin many ways from kiranvillagecom kiran wagle you have a good point msg is commonly used in soups in bottled sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potato chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fishand chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the problem we should call this barbecue potato chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavorings syndrome its been a few yearssince ive bought anything labelled with and other naturalflavorings from kiranvillagecom kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg was in the food that was the only difference same restaurant same ingredients how do you know this in order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise the preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lied about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil and produced some bizarre toxin that youre allergic to well i had had similar reactions many times that was when i reallystarted watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess whats inthere reaction to lawrys season salt guess whats in thereill give you a hint ive had enough problems with many many manydifferent products with msg that i figured out one thingunless i plan on getting sick i wont eat the stuff without myseldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am just trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and everytime i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food productsand consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my ownpersonal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and mostimportantly its enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proofthat my incredibly frugal fiance didnt flinch when i literally threwout or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when theres waste but it was a simpleexplanation i wont eat this stuff i wont cook with this stuff soi can either throw it out or give it away from patteeucsucoloradoedu donna pattee my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msg probably lawrys seasoning salt i love the way that tastes im not saying i never consume anything with msg ive noticed that ihave a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips

also iknow i have a problem with it and i wouldnt volunteer for a testlike thanks guys but i dont want to get sick also im sure thatmost people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities atdifferent times if i have a cold im much more susceptible to thereaction than when im healthy as proven today when im stuffy butfor some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbqchips from kiranvillagecom kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical you not you cathy go around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to the people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese foodthats why i suggested calling this diner syndrome cathy doesnt i havent saved all my postings but i never called itchinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only fromchinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct mypersonal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold ornot hold the msg i cant call up whoever makes doritos and ask themto make me one back of chips without msg on the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix or restaurant spice mixes im going to believe them and if anyone says they got msgsick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party im really going to believe them well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier post lets see you wrote this message atdate apr but on date apr gmti wrote has anyone had an msg reaction from something other than a chinese restaurant lots of times thats why it was so hard for me to pin down

the publics perception of doctors and their salariesi hope some of you will find it as amusing as i didreprinted wo permissiontheres no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors salariesby mike roykotribune media services on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors earnings is right up there it almost scored a perfect braindead it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called families usa the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians those polled said oh about a year would be ok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns plus and get the same results since the majority of americans dont make those bucks they assume that those who do are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but dont kid yourself karl marx lives its also stupid because it didnt ask key questions such as do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician if those polled said no they didnt know then they should have been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers they should have been dropped what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they dont know what it takes to become a doctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a average or better and c spend four more years of grinding study in medical school with the third and fourth years in clinical training working to hours a week and d spend another year as a lowpay hardwork intern and e put in another three to years of postgraduate training depending on your specialty and f maybe wind up in debt after medical school and g then work an average of hours a week with many family doctors putting in hours or more until they retire or fall over as you have probably guessed by now i have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake americas health care based on what doctors contribute to society they are far more useful than the powerhappy egotripping programspewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clintons first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the stupid poll indicates many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs of course doctors are wellcompensated they should be americans now live longer than ever but who is responsible for our longevitylawyers congress or the guy flipping burgers in a mcdonalds and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of selfindulgent lardbutted tvgaping couch cabbages ah that is not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain they might have been more honest if they had said let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have that problem is you my fellow american yes you eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of you guzzling too much hooch still puffing away at a pack getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure you and your habits not the doctors are the single biggest health problem in this country if anything it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do in fact i dont understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day so as your president i call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly now i must go get myself a triple cheesygreasy with double fries do as i say not as i do but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid there is another solution dont use them thats right you dont feel well then try one of those spine poppers needle twirlers or have rev bubba lay his

evenyoung people find the change unsettlingthough we have thought that this decrement in function after say anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip a common event in theelderly was due to

this report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdcs national hospital discharge survey nhds for and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from shortstay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since in the nhds conducted by cdcs national center for health statistics for medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of inpatients discharged from participating hospitals the cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the nhds sample of approximately women discharged after delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from national vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the nhds stated differences in this analysis are significant at the confidence level based on the twotailed ttest with a critical value of in there were cesareans per deliveries the same rate as in and similar to rates during table the primary cesarean rate ie number of first cesareans per deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans for also was stable ranging from to in the cesarean rate in the south was significantly p higher than the rates for the west midwest and northeast rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to years than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than beds than in larger hospitals and for deliveries for which blue crossblue shield and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment table the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early s the number and percentage of births to older women increased however if the age distribution of mothers in had remained the same as in the overall cesarean rate in would have been essentially the same as the observed based on the nhds of the approximately live births in an hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april estimated were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated births were repeat cesareans and were primary cesareans since approximately primary cesareans have been performed annually in of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with in of all cesareans in were associated with a previous cesarean with dystocia ie failure of labor to progress with breech presentation with fetal distress and with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in was days in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was days and for a repeat cesarean days nearly twice the duration for vbac deliveries days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs days in the average hospital stay for all deliveries was days for primary cesareans days for repeat cesareans days and for vbac and nonvbac vaginal deliveries and days respectively reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center for health statistics cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from through however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries objective postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase healthcare costs for example in the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were and respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes for physician fees and for hospital charges if the cesarean rate in had been the year objective instead of the number of cesarean births would have decreased by versus resulting in a savings of more than billion in physician fees and hospital charges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since several factors may impede progress toward the year national health objectives for cesarean delivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since of women who are offered a trial of labor could deliver vaginally a level already achieved by many hospitals trial of labor was routinely offered in of hospitals surveyed in the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national data are available when the vbac rate according to nhds data was the year objective specifies a vbac rate of based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peerreview process other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician and hospitalspecific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of

challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance although the risk of acquiring malaria for us citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and unpredictably during may the office of medical services department of state omsdos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official us personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of the health records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june compared with two cases during the same period in ehu omsdos and cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among us embassy personnel this report summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from of the reported casepatients were available for review by omsdos and cdc a case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for plasmodium sp of the persons were slideconfirmed as having malaria a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to obtain information about residence activities use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures ie using bednets and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long sleeves and pants in the

less than or equal to years than among persons greater than years this difference was not significant relative risk rr confidence interval ci eightytwo percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for years compared with those living there less than year travel outside of the kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine alone and proguanil alone in addition persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis the risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis rr ci twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets hicnet

used insect repellent in the evening compared with those who rarely used repellent rr upper confidence limit risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening as a result of this investigation ehu staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens ehu staff

health unit kampala uganda office of medical svcs dept of state washington dc malaria br div of parasitic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note in uganda the increase in malaria among us personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in subsaharan africa the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malariaendemic areas preventive measures that are also important for shortterm travelers to such areas mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most other areas with chloroquineresistant p falciparum however in some areas eg thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness in africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with p falciparum is mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at mg per week over a year period the risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis eg psychosis and convulsions is low ie episodes per users while the risk for less severe adverse reactions eg dizziness gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance eg southeast asia and africa in africa for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative although less effective regimen chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquineresistant p falciparum has not been

institute of dental research at the second international workshop on the oral manifestations of hiv infection held january february in san francisco participants explored issues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosal immunology and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection the workshop was organized by dr john greenspan and dr deborah greenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university of california san francisco an international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance the conference drew more than scientists from countries including asia africa europe central america south america as well as the united states and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the national institute of dental research the national cancer institute the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids research and the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision of oral care to the hivpositive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection and womens issues recommendations recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hivassociated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of hiv infection has hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april radically changed in hiv infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression and prognosis socialpolitical issues discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection focused on changing the publics attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed health care delivery for hivinfected patients and the need to educate the public about what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hivinhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hivinhibitory effect of saliva to the aggregationagglutination of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hivinfected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hivinfected children has tripled the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mothers serostatus is known prior to giving birth periodontal and gingival tissue diseasehicnet medical newsletter page volume number april oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy occupational and treatment issues occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hivinfected individuals and treatment rendered by hivinfected health care professionals still command considerable attention factors under consideration include the costbenefit of hiv testing patienttohealth care provider transmission of hiv infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of hivinfected patients conference participants anticipate that a third international workshop on the

administration monica revelle the food and drug administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or lifethreatening illnesses such as aids cancer and alzheimers disease these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan md the effort to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a longterm commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease are used the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established the drugs sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drugs effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness one new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when fda determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight said fda commissioner david a kessler md while drug approval will be accomplished faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal

retinal disease national retinitis pigmentosa foundation neutrophilic factors rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests baltimore md researchers at the university of california san francisco and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq regn have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of lightsensing cells in the retina of the eye the degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment this research published to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pnas holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists it is estimated that million americans have severe vision loss due to agerelated macular degeneration and americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes blindness in addition each year more than people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas the research was funded in part by the rp retinitis pigmentosa foundation fighting blindness regeneron

regenerons vice president for discovery regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from ucsf in the research described in the pnas a lightdamage model was used to assess the survivalpromoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light exposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor ngf and insulinlike growth factor igf were not effective in these experiments discussing the research dr jesse m

increases risk of heart disease research resources reporter written by mary weideman novdec national institutes of health highfat highcalorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according to investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past years dr connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the name tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of miles or more while kicking a machetecarved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food contains approximately percent of total calories as fat of which the majority percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of mg dl lowdensity lipoprotein ldlcholesterol levels of mgdl and highdensity lipoprotein hdlcholesterol levels of to mgdl all of those values are in the good lowrisk range according to the researchers elevated cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april disease hdlcholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to highcholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldlcholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for week followed by weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterolsaturation index or csi recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet csi indicates the diets potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of dr connors affluent diet used in the study ranks a csi of the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fat andor cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating on a plateau dr connor says after weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rose percent hdlcholesterol increased by per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceride levels increased by percent and subjects averaged an pound gain in weight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after days of affluent diet as after days hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations we think hdlcholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to percent of the total calories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than percent of total calories as fat less than mg of cholesterol and a csi around varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a mediterraneanstyle diet the original mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given societys elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general wellbeing rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a highrisk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is percent less than it was years ago so a lot has been accomplished we are changing rapidly he concludeshicnet medical newsletter page volume number april general announcments publications for health

of an hiv vaccine nature vol no p volvovitz franklin and smith gale the questions raised by moore et al about recombinant gp envelope glycoprotein precursor from hiv produced by microgenesys are advantages rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd receptor and that this recombinant gp does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp in patients infected with hiv broadens hiv specific envelopedirected immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp epitopes and cd and cd cytotoxic tcell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody responses against native hiv proteins including the types described by moore et al exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april progression of hiv disease in addition the binding of gp or gpantibody complexes to cd has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection the absence of cd binding by the microgenesys gp vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd counts stimulation of cytotoxic t cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other clinical results microgenesys gp was chosen by researchers at the karolinska institute in sweden for the first phase iii vaccine therapy studies conclude volvovitz and smith hiv infection breast milk and hiv transmission lancet vol no p mok jacqueline there are still more questions than answers regarding hivpositive women breastfeeding their babies writes jacqueline mok of the lancet the antiinfective properties of milk are well documented while the numbers of leukocytes concentrations of lactoferrin and iga and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels lactoferrin and iga then increase from three to twelve months with percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in both normal and uninfected children born to hivpositive mothers the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv infected children had a longer median incubation time months than bottlefed infants months breastfed children also had a slower progression to aids there is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against hiv infection studies of the biological properties of milk from hiv infected women showed the presence of igg and iga antibodies against envelope glycoproteins as well as iga antibodies against core antigens binding of hiv to the cd receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor in the developing world where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality breast milk is still the best food for infants regardless of the mothers hiv status transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded the possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with hiv at birth and may even delay progression to aids concludes mok absence of hiv transmission from an infected dentist to his patients journal of the american medical association vol no p dickinson gordon m et al if universal precautions are practiced the risk of hiv transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal write gordon m dickinson hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april et al of the university of miami school of medicine in miami fla the researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with aids and attempts were made to contact all patients for hiv testing living patients with newly detected hiv infection were interviewed and dna sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of years were examined in detail there were patients who had undergone procedures of whom were deceased an examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with hiv infection all of whom were either homosexuals or ivdrug users the researchers were able to detect of the remaining patients and agreed to be tested hiv infection was reported in five of the patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied highrisk behavior comparative dna sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related the study suggests the potential for hiv transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed conclude dickinson et al april aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb study says washington post p a tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control according to a study published in todays new england journal of medicine people who contract tb usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria again but a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new tb infection doctors found peter m small of the howard hughes medical institute at stanford university director of the study said that in order to protect against reinfection it may be necessary for some people to use tb medicines permanently the study examined the genetic makeup of tb bacteria and how the germs changed over time in patients at kings county hospital in new

delay progression to aids concludes mok hiv and the aetiology of aids lancet vol no p duesberg peter because there is no proof that hiv is the cause of aids the hypothesis that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically azt and psychologically positive aids test toxic public health initiatives writes peter duesberg of the university of californiaberkeley in the lancets march issue schechter et al call duesbergs hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to aids a hindrance to public health initiatives however their hypothesis that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits the us government spends billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no aids control have resulted from work on this hypothesis schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver however their survey neglects to disprove duesbergs drugaids hypothesis because it does not provide controlsie confirmed drugfree aids casesand because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt use altogether to refute duesbergs hypothesis schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to years hivpositive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same aids risks as positives who do not do so the year period is claimed by hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids alternatively they could show that hivfree individuals who have used drugs for years never get aidsdefining illnesses concludes duesberg rapid decline of cd cells after ifna treatment in hiv infection lancet vol no p vento sandro et al interferon ifn which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in some settings may hasten cd tcell loss in some hiv infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions write sandro vento et al of the a pugliese hospital in catanzaro italy the researchers report three asymptomatic hiv infected individuals with hepatitis c virus related chronic active hepatitis cah who had a rapid profound decline of cd cells after ifn all three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum hiv p antigen and had circulating antibodies to p sera from all three patients obtained at the end of ifn treatment and testing in enzymelinked immunosorbent assay contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii antigens homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of hiv gp these autoantibodies which also recognize native class ii molecules and may contribute to the elimination of cd t cells in vivo were at low tires in all three patients six months after stopping ifn such autoantibodies were not detected in other patients with hiv infection and hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not experience cd tcell loss in some hiv infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions the subjects had a b dr and b dr hla antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd cell counts and clinical progression of hiv disease ifn can induce a very rapid decline of cd cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these hla haplotypes the researchers conclude april tb makes a comeback state government news vol no p voit william and knapp elaine s although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the united states it is emerging again among the homeless aids patients immigrants minorities and prisoners dr lee b reichman professor of medicine at the university of new jersey medical school and president of the american lung association said right now its a big city problem but potentially its everyones problem the ala predicts that million americans are infected with tb and about percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed especially those with aids or hiv gene hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april tammes a centers for disease control expert said that is why the cdc has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix aids with tb patients state health officials believe the tb is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment in addition the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services in new york city tb is an epidemic because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people said dr george diferdinando director of the new york state tb control according to diferdinando curbing the spread of tb entails keeping percent or more of diagnosed tb cases in treatment about percent of infected new york city residents dont complete therapy when tb patients dont finish taking their medication multidrug resistant tb can develop which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat increasing frequency of heterosexually transmitted aids in southern florida artifact or reality american journal of public health vol no p nwanyanwu okey c et al the alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired aids cases in southern florida was partially related to misclassification of risk write okey c nwanyanwu et al of the centers for disease control in atlanta ga the researchers investigated such aids cases from broward and coastal palm beach counties all of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men injecting drug users or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of hiv transmission medical records of patients in addition to records from social services hiv counseling and testing centers and sexually transmitted disease std clinics were reviewed if no other hiv risk factor was found from medical record review patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire once std clinic and other medical records were reviewed men and women were reclassified into other hiv transmission categories after adjustments were made for the reclassification the percentage of aids cases reported from palm beach and broward counties between january and march that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from percent to percent among men and from percent to percent among women while the percentage of heterosexually transmitted aids cases in southern florida decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases it still remained above the national

bethesda md april absence of hiv transmission from an infected orthopedic surgeon journal of the american medical association vol no p von reyn c fordham the risk of hiv transmission from an hivpositive surgeon to patient is extremely low provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of the dartmouthhitchcock medical center in lebanon nh the researchers contacted former patients on whom an hivpositive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between january and june the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for hiv a total of former patients underwent hiv testing representing percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the year period patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure all patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzymelinkedimmunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study notifying patients of the infected surgeons hivstatus is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended the researchers conclude investigation of potential hiv transmission to the patients of an hivinfected surgeon journal of the american medical association vol hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april no p smith rogers audrey et al the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple methodologically similar investigations writes audrey smith rogers et al of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore md the researchers identified a total of persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between and and for whom the hivpositive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon the aids case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained among the patients were dead had no address had test results known and did not respond to the questionnaire no study patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newly detected hivpositive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in personhours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per personhours of surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infectioncontrol guidelines over percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person was found to be infected with hiv the study patients infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hivpositive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april drug concerns to share aids data new york times p c kolata gina a total of major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highly unusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway nj arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including actup dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease said were delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for aids related stories wall street journal p b philadelphia inquirer p a usa today p b the next step in aids treatment nature vol no p maddox john although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with hiv the findings do not indicate that azt should not be administered in people with fullblown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hivpositive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of tcell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd counts of the people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of followup have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hivinfected individuals and that cd cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appearedthere is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and antiinfective properties of breastmilk from hivinfected women lancet vol no p van de perre philippe et al a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm type in the mothers body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv from mother to child write philippe van de perre et al of the hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national aids control program in kigali rwanda the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of antiinfective substances in breastmilk or both factors a total of hivinfected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali rwanda milk samples were collected days months and months post partum hiv igg secretory iga and igm were assayed by western blot for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g in the day and month samples the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers gag pol and env at days months and months post partum hiv specific igg was detected in percent percent and percent of breastmilk samples iga in percent percent and percent and igm in percent percent and percent in children who survived longer than months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hivinfected cells in the milk days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga antihiv in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv the researchers conclude april firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce p a a total of fifteen us and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on earlystage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug edward scolnick president of merck co research laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together said participants in addition to merck the other companies involved in the intercompany collaboration for aids drug development are bristolmyers squibb co burroughs wellcome glaxo inc hoffmanla roche eli lilly co pfizer inc smithkline beecham ab astra du pont merck syntex inc boehringer ingelheim miles inc and sigmatau the participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively involved in hiv antiviral development may participate scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april and early clinical data the american foundation for aids research amfar was pleased with the news of the collaboration which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance related story financial times p guidance over hivinfected healthcare workers lancet vol no p horton richard the united kingdoms department of health recently followed the advice of aids experts that there is no scientific reason for routine hiv testing among healthcare workers following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted hiv the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases dr kenneth calman chief medical officer said doctors dentists nurses and other healthcare workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv infection including if appropriate diagnostic hiv testing he said infected health care workers should not

problems so im not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not rutin is not a herb but part of the bioflavonoid complex you should generally not take rutin by itself but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead if you dont and there are some exceptions to that youll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency which is the other major component of the bioflavonoid complex i found out the hard way years ago when i recommended rutin after it showed deficient in patients who were not deficient in hesperidin be fore a later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin which from then on made me always add bioflavonoids to anyone that had very low levels of rutin most of the time people are equally low in rutin and hesperidin so there is really no reason to take rutin by itself but use the whole bioflavonoid complex instead i have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids varicose veins chronic nose bleeds aneurysms gastrointestinal bleeding due to drugs etc one patient in desperation took a whole bottle s in one day for his painful bleeding hemorrhoids without any ill effects they are also

psychological in places where this distinction becomes important i mentioned that the dsmiiir mentions impulses as a possible diagnostic marker however this might look like somethingpeople associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable orunpredictable behaviors which is not the case with ocd one of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individualcan and does suppress some of their

treatments are available may deserve to be called a quack antifungals are in a different class the big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice he deals with critical care patients where fungal infectionsystemic is a real problem and just because he tries to keep good bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this i think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the anorectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic usethe problem we have here david is proof that gi discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom the arguement is that without proof no action is warrentedmedicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intakethe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapyif it makes sense for livestock why doesnt it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consider yogurt dangerous

hallersubject resound hearing aid theory as i understand itthe following is based on copies i was given of some articles published inhearing instruments i would appreciate any comments about this and othernew technology for hearing aidsthe resound system was developed on the basis of some research at att andappears to take a different approach from other aids it appears to me thata new programmable aid like the widex just uses a more flexible andprogrammable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts ofthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and helpout in noisy situationsthe major difference in the resound approach is that it divides thespectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmableapparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found inthe low frequencies while the important consonant informationunfortunately for me is in the high frequencies the two bands then aretreated with different compression schemes which are programable they havealso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they callabnormal growth of loudnessthis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though ithink the phrase is missleading what appears to be the case is that as youexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficitbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reachthe too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge this meansthat if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the highend for people with hearing losses hence what you want is progressivelyless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable pointyou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentiallydifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum speciallyfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to cps and then fallsoff a cliffaids with simple compressors dont

that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearlyunderstood that antibiotic exposure is a

described is in treating particularlyrecalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection thereare case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulatethe patients flora dont

broadspectrum antibiotic use except that it isnt at least symptomatically apparent diseasemedicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for

antifungal creams lucky how since a recent article randomized controlled trial of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis ive mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating ounces of yogurt daily it turns out most would rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infections yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline again this just isnt what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy dont seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea but i dont think anyone would view this as a quack therapy david rindyogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus and l bulgaricus l acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free most of the commercial yogurt sold in the us has a very low l acidophilus and l bulgaricus count neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem gordon r has told me through email that he gives his patients l acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobeswhich setup shop in the colon but he hasnt told me which ones yet the lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will setup shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chancemouth anus sinus cavity and vagina having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina i have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms i know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body im not ready to buy that yet i do believe that complications at specific sitesvagina anal and maybe lower colon sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow uncheckedrestoring the right bacterial balance is the best wayin my opinion to get rid of the problem antifungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin a supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the ph to basically starve the candida outmarty bfrom banschbachvmsocomokstateedusubject re candidayeast bloom fact or fictionin article rhfrkinnshelleyuwashingtonedu nodroghardyuwashingtonedu gordon rubenfeld writes banschbachvmsocomokstateedu writes to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broadspectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers preop liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soontobe high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations ill leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora dont try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc antifungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the anorectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broadspectrum antibiotic use except that it isnt at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdombecause clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukeswe wadejs leejy dockerybk hainjd ti a randomized doubleblind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so nengljmed dec p psychological tests results the three activetreatment regimens and the allplacebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of longterm nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didnt use sporanox despite crooks recommendation for nystatin maybe they didnt avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapyif it makes sense for livestock why doesnt it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatmentunless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty youve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we cant seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion im lostcandida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygenjust like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections im really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it outthe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trialsthe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical sceneand a very important one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it outofhand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safelylike it

humans or the ability of anecdotallyeffective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirman etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we cant seem tofocus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion im lostpoint im beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the wholeyeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meaningsof words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargonnecessary for precise communication within their field which im fullycognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for thesituation in scimed many times the words or phrases used by doctors canhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in theworld at large causing significant miscommunication one example wordand very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemicit is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific muchmore so than its meaning to a nondoctor there is also the observation ofthis newsgroup that both doctors and nondoctors come together on essentiallyequal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fanthe flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors getreally beat up by nondoctors for their views on medicine which theyotherwise dont see much of in their practice except for the occasionaldifficult patientpoint i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will notprescribe any treatmentstherapies for their patients unless such treatmentshave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from wellconstructedclinical trials usually doubleblind or that such treatmentstherapies arepart of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do anydifferently would in this belief system be unethical practice and itfollows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a nontherapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis ortheory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolationof what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either froma treatment pointofviewand by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practicescience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however asalso being a human being last i checked and having been one of those peoplethat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment wherestandard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back andwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is initself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlyingintent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health ofthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so thepatient should come first when considering treatmentwhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies boththe scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post ioutlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give anyphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribealternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidencefor patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhaustedand not until then the patient would be fully informed that suchtherapiestreatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and thatthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derivedfrom themthis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfiesthe humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patientswho have reached a deadend in the treatment of their symptoms using acceptedmedicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to thedoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losingtheir license or worse to nondoctors who have not had the proper medicaltraining this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the controlmore within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleanedcould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the mostproductive way everybody wins in this admittedly rosecolored approach imsure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presentedmore as a strawman to stimulate discussionhopefully what i write here may give the scimed doctors a better idea as towhy i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have realdifficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the purescientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medicaltreatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with andby the scientific aspects anything

that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well with the help of an md friend of the family we had all his medication discontinued he had a seizure that night and was put back
