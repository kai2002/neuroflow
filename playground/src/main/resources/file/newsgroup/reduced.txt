i have been active in defending saturn lately on the net and would like to state my full opinion on the subject rather than just reply to others points the biggest problem some people seem to be having is that saturn dealers make k on a car i think most will agree with me that the car is comparably priced with its competitors that is they arent overpriced compared to most cars in their class i dont understand the point of arguing over whether the dealer makes the k or not i have never understood what the big deal over dealer profits is either the only thing that i can figure out is that people believe that if they minimize the dealer profit they will minimize their total outofpocket expenses for the car while this may be true in some cases i do not believe that it is generally true i bought a saturn sl in january of at that time based on studying car prices i decided that there was no comparable car that was priced as cheaply as the saturn sure maybe i could have talked the price for some other car to the saturn price but my outofpocket expenses wouldnt have been any different whats important to me is how much money i have left after i buy the car reducing dealer profit is not the same thing as saving money show me how reducing dealer profit saves me money and ill believe that its important my experience has been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money fredsay you bought your saturn at k with a dealer profit of kif the dealer profit is then you would only be paying k forthe same car so isnt that saving moneymoreover if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by then their cars will be even better deals say if the price of a saturn wasalready below market average for the class of cars then after theyreduce the dealer profit it would be below market average it will attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money force the competitors to lower their prices to survivenow not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit even the buyers for other cars will pay lessisnt that saving moneydougfrom tedebearlelandstanfordedu theodore chensubject re are bmws worth the price in article aprwdlloralcom gwmsplsplloralcom gary w mahan writesroad and track bmwis s mile s road test annual s mile sthose are the numbers i was quoting i have driven the older model but not thenewersure smuounds like they got a ringer the is i drove was definitelyfaster than that if you want to quote numbers my aw autofile shows in mile in it quotes car and drivers figuresof and oh btw these numbers are for the ii dont know how the addition of variable valve timing for affects itbut dont take my word for it go drive itteddyfrom netopstekgenbvtekcom randy kingsubject re headlights problemthanks to all of you who responded to my posting the problem with my trucks headlights low beam problem was a loose wire connection it was not the fuse as a minority of you suggestedthanks againfrom netopstekgenbvtekcom randy kingsubject left turn signal wont stop automaticalythe subject says it all my chev s pickups left turn signal doesnot stop after turning what cause this to stop automaticaly is thisa mechanical problem by the steering wheelnote this truck has an after market steering wheel gtgrant installedfrom lxrosserccocaltechedu alex rossersubject re what is volvo wolfsonregattaspsmotcom stephen wolfson writesin article marugleunitno oepcolargoledbtihno oep writes which turns into a teenagers car when it gets old the average lifelength of a volvo in norway is years and in sweden yearsof course someone pointed out when saab or volvo was running theirat least years ads that the average milage was significantlyless than than the us averagethat my be but every volvo ive ever owned has lasted far longer than mostother cars volvo miles still on the road volvo miles still on the road volvo miles still on the roadand ill admit the dealer repair cost is high but with some mechanicalaptitude of your own and finding a good indi mechanic you can avoid mostbreakdowns and make the rest cheapthe sum total of the repairs on the car with miles has been mufflers and a radiator whoa bad repair record and all
