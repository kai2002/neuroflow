Former Ford engineer Kip Ewing is among the latest auto industry veterans to join Karma Automotive, the upstart electric car company built on the ashes of Fisker. The company is opening a new Troy, Michigan engineering center, an outpost of the company’s California headquarters and manufacturing operation.

Karma has grown from 20 to 500 employees in two years. The company will ramp up its Michigan facility to 80 employees this year and plans to have a total of 150 people working out of Troy by next year. Ewing will serve as chief engineer and is among the most recent Karma hires that hail from the ranks of Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce, Tesla, Ford, FCA, and GM and will report to Darren Post, who is heading Karma’s engineering efforts. Ewing was on the Ford team that led the development of the 2017 Ford GT and its predecessor, and his May departure from Ford was a surprise.

They say there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and for doctors fed by drug companies, the old adage might be true. Even cheap meals provided by pharmaceutical sales reps were associated with higher prescription rates for the brands being promoted, a new JAMA Internal Medicine study concluded.

Researchers delved into data from the U.S. Open Payments database, mandated by the Sunshine Act, and matched it with Medicare Part D prescribing information on more than 276,000 doctors. They focused specifically on meals, rather than speaking fees or research payments.

They also focused on four on-patent drugs from four different drug classes, three treating cardiovascular issues and one antidepressant. AstraZeneca’s Crestor represented statin meds; Forest Laboratories’ Bystolic represented beta blockers; Daiichi Sankyo’s Benicar, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers; and Pfizer’s Pristiq, SSRI and SNRI antidepressants.
